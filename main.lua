-- g9-battle-engine boot (round 6 rebuild)
--
-- Faithful restoration of the canonical (tectorifter/Gen9Dex) boot sequence:
-- every subsystem is loaded in the same data-then-engine order the real
-- main.lua uses, but each install is pcall-guarded so a broken subsystem
-- logs a warning and the boot ALWAYS continues (standing rule: the mod must
-- never crash the boot). The guard also means the mod keeps loading even if
-- an optional dependency (battle_forms, modern_type_framework, ...) is
-- absent -- an absent subsystem simply logs and the rest of the engine still
-- comes up.
--
-- Deliberate scope notes (see src/README.md, round 6):
--   * The canonical main.lua's INLINE phases are now reproduced too:
--     species-evolution patching, evolution-item registration, happiness
--     evolution, movepool sub-effect wiring (wireMovepoolSubEffects +
--     installMovepoolEffects), and move-name display -- all pcall-guarded.
--     All 150 sibling files referenced from the entry load (142 canonical
--     repo siblings via loadSibling, byte-identical to tectorifter/
--     Gen9Dex, plus 8 round-4 damage-brain files via require).
--   * trainers/temp_test_registrations.lua (test artifact) is skipped;
--     gigantamax/gimmick_dynamax.lua stays CANONICAL-DISABLED (round 12):
--     battle_forms owns Dynamax/Gigantamax activation and mechanics end to
--     end (its own src/dynamax.lua + hpscale.lua + maxmoves.lua), so the
--     full parallel Dynamax engine gimmick_dynamax would double-count --
--     instead we boot gigantamax/dynamax_battle.lua, the consume-only
--     processor reading battle_forms' dynamax_applied/dynamax_reverted
--     trigger (Dynamax Level drive into battle_forms' own HP stamp; the
--     Showdown-verified Max/G-Max move secondaries live in
--     gigantamax/max_move_subeffects.lua, processed exactly like every
--     other move in this mod).
--     installGigantamaxMoves (canonical-disabled) and derivedHeightWeight
--     (only used by postgame_species.lua, which this fork doesn't ship)
--     are intentionally skipped.
--   * mod.exports.isMoveDataComplete is the canonical completeness gate
--     (ported below) so combat/learnset_ownership.lua works unchanged.
--
-- Exports that end up live after this boot (set by the files themselves,
-- not faked here): resolveTurnActions, computeTurnOrder,
-- registerPriorityModifier, orderSwitchInMons, orderActiveBattlers,
-- registerTrainer, hasRegisteredTrainer, askBattleChoice,
-- battleChoiceActive, cancelBattleChoice, abilityIdOf, abilityBehaviorOf,
-- setAbility, requestAdjacency, requestSwitch, setMonTypes,
-- registerDamageModifier, changeStage, currentWeather, setWeather,
-- setMonDynamaxLevel, setGigantamaxFactor, setTeraType, getTeraType,
-- isTerastallized, ShowdownPrimitives, ModernStats, MoveCategory,
-- damagePipeline, moveUsability/moveUsabilityReason/moveUsabilityFlag/
-- registerMoveUsabilityGate/itemMoveBanned, and every register*Modifier chain.
