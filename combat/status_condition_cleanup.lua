-- One central "what a switch (or the end of a battle) takes away" pass for
-- the turn-counted status conditions THIS MOD owns (ROUND 33).
--
-- The real problem this closes: on Gen 2 the battle's active battlers ARE
-- plain party-mon tables (`battle.player == save.party[1]`, and
-- `Battle.party IS save.party` -- gen2/Battle.lua's own words), and the
-- engine's `Battle:clearVolatile(mon)` only nils `mon.volatile`. Everything
-- native keeps in that volatile store is therefore dropped on a switch for
-- free, and everything this mod keeps in a DIRECT field on the mon table
-- (Leech Seed, Disable, Yawn, Perish Song, Telekinesis, Heal Block,
-- Embargo, Throat Chop, Nightmare, Ingrain, Foresight, Miracle Eye, Smack
-- Down, Stockpile, the Outrage/Uproar lock) is NOT -- it survived every
-- switch, and worse, every BATTLE, because the party table is the save
-- file. Real Showdown clears every one of these on switch (`noCopy`
-- volatiles / onSwitchIn resets), so a seeded or disabled mon that leaves
-- the field must come back clean. (`wonderRoomActive` is deliberately NOT
-- in this list -- combat/trick_room.lua owns that one, because its value
-- must be RE-APPLIED to a mon switching IN while the room is up, not
-- simply cleared; splitting the two responsibilities keeps either file
-- from undoing the other's write.)
--
-- toxicCounter is the other half. Real Showdown's `tox` (data/conditions.ts)
-- has BOTH `onStart` and `onSwitchIn` set `effectState.stage = 0`, so a
-- badly-poisoned mon that switches out restarts its ramp at 1/16 on the
-- way back in. The native Gen 2 `Battle.STATUSES.toxic` never resets
-- `mon.toxicCounter` anywhere (only selfdestruct/Rest written a nil
-- counter), so before this file the ramp simply continued from wherever it
-- was -- confirmed by direct read, not assumed.
--
-- Hooked on the engine's own real events, the same ones the rest of this
-- mod already consumes:
--   battle.battler_switched -- emitted by every Gen 2 switch path
--     (Battle:switch / switchEnemy / forcedReplacement / switchFainted)
--     and by Gen 1's BattleState resolveSwitch/switch sites, with
--     `previous` (whoever left) and `battler` (whoever walked in).
--   battle.started / battle.ended -- the cross-battle sweep: nothing a
--     battle wrote may be left on a party table (the exact principle
--     gen2/Battle.lua's own `clearAllVolatiles` header already states),
--     and a battle that ended mid-Leech-Seed or mid-Disable must not hand
--     the next battle or the save file a stale counter.
return function(mod)
  -- Every direct-on-the-mon field this mod owns that is switch-scoped in
  -- the real games. Deliberately excludes the major-status bookkeeping
  -- (`status`, Gen 2 `statusTurns`, Gen 1 `sleepTurns`): a status persists
  -- through a switch in the real games, so its counter must too -- only
  -- the VOLATILE conditions reset.
