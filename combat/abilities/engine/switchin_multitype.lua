-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/multitype_switchin.lua -- Phase 1.8,
-- the first of this directory's "passive, derived-type" abilities
-- (Multitype, Forecast, Mimicry), deferred from Phase 1 pending their own
-- design pass.
--
-- PLATE_TYPE is the one genuinely new (non-duplicated) piece: national_dex
-- 's own MULTITYPE record describes its effect only in prose ("the type
-- matching its held Plate"), with no structured Plate->type table --
-- built here from national_dex's own ITEM registry instead (confirmed by
-- direct read, data/items/generated/api/*.lua: each of the 16 real
-- elemental Plates carries an explicit "Held by a Multitype Pokemon:
-- Holder's type becomes <Type>" effect line). BLANKPLATE and LEGENDPLATE
-- are deliberately excluded -- confirmed neither carries that effect line
-- at all (Blank Plate has no effect; Legend Plate only boosts Judgment's
-- power).
--
-- Explicit user correction, this session: unlike Forecast/Mimicry,
-- Multitype does NOT reactively re-check mid-battle. Arceus's type is
-- fixed to whichever Plate it's holding the moment it enters battle, the
-- same way its FORM is fixed then -- not something the real games ever
-- re-derive live while it's already out (the same is true of Genesect's
-- Drives, cited by the user as a parallel case, though Genesect's own
-- Drives affect Techno Blast's type, not Genesect's own typing, so it
-- isn't wired here at all). Switch-in only, the same two-event pattern
-- (battle.started + battle.battler_switched) every other switch_in
-- ability engine in this directory already uses -- no weather/terrain/
-- item-change listener, unlike abilities/engine/forecast_weather.lua and
-- abilities/engine/mimicry_terrain.lua.
--
-- Reuses combat/type_override_primitives.lua's setMonTypes/canChangeType
-- (Tera always blocks; self-activated Dynamax is unaffected) -- the same
-- primitives Protean/Libero/Soak/Color Change already go through.
