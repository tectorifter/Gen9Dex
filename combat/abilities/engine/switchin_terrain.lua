-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/terrain_switchin.lua -- that file is
-- only an inclusion list; the terrain value is read LIVE from national_dex
-- 's own abilityBehaviorOf here, at dispatch time, every time. TERRAIN_KEY
-- is the one genuinely new (non-duplicated) piece: PokeAPI's own lowercase
-- terrain spelling (national_dex's behaviour.effects[].terrain) mapped to
-- this engine's own ELECTRIC/GRASSY/MISTY/PSYCHIC keys -- a plain 1:1
-- rename, no special cases like weather's own hail->SNOW override.
--
-- Sets the field's terrain via mod.exports.setTerrain (combat/
-- modern_terrain.lua's own primitive, extracted from its move starters so
-- a move and an ability never duplicate the "already this terrain -> no-
-- op, a different one -> replaces it" + duration + message logic).
--
-- Triggers: battle.started + battle.battler_switched -- identical two-
-- event pattern abilities/engine/switchin_stat_change.lua's own header
-- explains in full.
--
-- No failure message on a no-op, unlike a move: a real ability re-checks
-- silently.
