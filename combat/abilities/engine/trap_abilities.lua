-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/trap_abilities.lua -- Phase 7 of the
-- ability roadmap (ARENATRAP, SHADOWTAG, MAGNETPULL, RUNAWAY).
--
-- GEN 2 ONLY, real reason (not a shortcut): Gen 2's own native trap
-- system already has exactly the real choke point this family needs --
-- `Battle:switchLocked()` (gen2/Battle.lua:3710), which TryPlayerSwitch's
-- own real cartridge logic (`.check_trapped`) already gates a VOLUNTARY
-- switch on, reading `self:volatile(self.enemy).trapsTarget` -- the same
-- flag Mean Look/Block/Spider Web already set. Wrapped (not written into
-- directly, to avoid colliding with a real Mean Look-set flag) so the
-- final answer is "native says locked, OR an ability says locked."
--
-- Gen 1 has no equivalent choke point in this engine at all -- confirmed
-- by direct read: `BattleState.lua` has exactly one public switch entry
-- point, `resolveSwitch(newMon)`, called directly by the menu layer with
-- no separate "can I switch" gate anywhere upstream of it (Gen 1's own
-- real trapping, Bind/Wrap/Fire Spin, blocks switching as a SIDE EFFECT
-- of locking the whole turn via `target.trappingTurns`'s "can't move"
-- check -- cartridge-accurate for a move-based trap, but not the shape an
-- ability-based trap needs, since the trapped mon must still be able to
-- attack normally). Refusing inside resolveSwitch itself is not attempted
-- here -- this codebase has no confirmed-safe way to abort a menu-driven
-- switch mid-flight without risking a silent hang, a real, structural gap
-- named rather than guessed around.
