-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/weather_switchin.lua -- that file is
-- only an inclusion list; the weather value is read LIVE from national_dex
-- 's own abilityBehaviorOf here, at dispatch time, every time. The one
-- genuinely new (non-duplicated) piece is WEATHER_KEY: PokeAPI's own
-- lowercase weather spelling (national_dex's behaviour.effects[].weather)
-- mapped to this engine's own RAIN/SUN/SAND/SNOW keys --
-- SNOWWARNING's own record literally says weather="hail", but this engine
-- deliberately has no hail value at all (combat/modern_weather.lua's own
-- header: "Snow (Snowscape) is Gen 9's real replacement... we won't bring
-- hail yet") -- mapped to SNOW here, consistent with that already-
-- established project decision, not a new guess. Every other mapping here
-- is a plain 1:1 rename.
--
-- Sets the field's weather via the exact primitive combat/
-- modern_weather.lua's own move starters already use.
--
-- Duration: real current Showdown -- an ability-set weather lasts the same
-- 5/8 turns a move-set one does (no held-item extension applies to an
-- ability trigger, since the setter never "holds" the weather-rock item
-- for its OWN ability the way a move's user would need to) -- so this
-- passes the setter mon through combat/field_duration.lua's own
-- resolveFieldDuration exactly like modern_weather.lua's weatherStarter
-- does, keeping the Damp Rock/Heat Rock/Smooth Rock/Icy Rock check
-- available for free if a Pokemon happens to hold the matching rock AND
-- have the matching ability.
--
-- Triggers: battle.started + battle.battler_switched -- identical two-
-- event pattern abilities/engine/switchin_stat_change.lua's own header
-- explains in full (both are real, separate, and both needed).
--
-- "Already this weather -> does nothing" (no failure message, unlike a
-- move): a real Showdown ability re-checks silently, never prints a "but
-- it failed" line the way a move would -- this file matches that by simply
-- not re-setting an already-matching weather rather than emitting
-- anything.
