-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/type_immunity.lua -- Phase 3b of
-- the ability roadmap, alongside abilities/engine/status_immunity.lua's
-- own Phase 3a. Which move type is blocked, and the reaction (heal
-- fraction or stat-change stages) that fires instead, are both read
-- LIVE from national_dex's own abilityBehaviorOf at hit time -- nothing
-- here is a hardcoded per-ability fact except which EFFECT ENTRY is the
-- reaction (the record's own `when` text, "hit by a <Type>-type move",
-- distinguishes a hit-reaction effect from an unrelated one on the same
-- ability, e.g. Dry Skin's separate weather-tick effects -- confirmed
-- real strings, not guessed, via a direct dump of all five abilities'
-- full effect arrays this session).
--
-- WHY THIS IS A "battle.damage" WRAP, NOT A registerDamageModifier ENTRY
-- OR A battle.damage_dealt LISTENER: a registerDamageModifier only ever
-- scales the final number, it can't ALSO fire a heal/stat-change
-- reaction inline; and battle.damage_dealt is confirmed (combat/
-- boss_fight_status.lua's own header) to fire only for a landed,
-- NON-ZERO hit -- forcing damage to 0 via a modifier would mean that
-- event never fires at all, losing the reaction entirely. Wrapping
-- "battle.damage" directly (the same hook combat/modern_combat_protect
-- .lua's own Protect block and combat/modern_items.lua's Fling/
-- Incinerate/Belch checks already use) lets this file compute the
-- reaction and the zero-damage result in the SAME step, with no
-- downstream event to depend on.
--
-- PRIORITY 40 -- below modern_combat_protect.lua's own Protect block
-- (50), matching real Showdown: a protected target's Water Absorb does
-- NOT trigger (the move fails outright, never "hits" for absorption
-- purposes) -- Protect's own wrap runs first in the chain and returns
-- without calling next() whenever the target is protected, so this
-- wrap never even executes for a protected hit. Above modern_combat
-- .lua's own damage-formula wrap (0) and matching modern_items.lua's
-- own move-id-specific checks (also 40, Fling/Incinerate/Belch) -- safe
-- to share that tier since every entry at it is mutually exclusive by
-- what it actually matches (a specific move id there, a specific
-- ability here), so which one runs first within the tier never changes
-- the outcome.
