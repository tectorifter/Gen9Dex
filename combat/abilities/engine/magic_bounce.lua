  -- Real Showdown logic, verified before writing anything here (this
  -- file's own first draft approximated with damageClass=="status" and
  -- target=="selected-pokemon" -- WRONG, caught by explicit user
  -- correction: real Magic Bounce gates on ONE flag, `reflectable`
  -- (national_dex's own moveFlags(id).reflectable -- confirmed real and
  -- live, sourced directly from Showdown's own moves.json, e.g.
  -- STEALTHROCK's own real flags record: {metronome=true,
  -- mustpressure=true, reflectable=true}). That single flag already
  -- covers BOTH single-target status moves (Thunder Wave, Toxic, Will-
  -- O-Wisp -- all confirmed reflectable=true) AND field-wide entry-
  -- hazard moves (Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Sticky Web --
  -- ALL confirmed reflectable=true too) uniformly -- there was never a
  -- real reason to exclude hazards by target-string, and doing so was
  -- this file's own real bug, not a deliberate scope cut.
  --
  -- Hazards bouncing correctly is a property of the redirect mechanism
  -- itself, not something this file has to special-case: combat/
  -- modern_hazards.lua's own real setters (GALAR_STEALTHROCK_EFFECT
  -- etc.) resolve WHICH SIDE gets the hazard via
  -- `n.battle:sideOf(n.target)` -- i.e. off whoever the CURRENT move's
  -- target argument is, not a fixed field. Once this file's own whole-
  -- move redirect swaps attacker<->defender and re-dispatches through
  -- the real native entry point, that same setter naturally reads the
  -- NEW target (the original attacker) and sets the hazard on THEIR
  -- side -- exactly the real, correct Magic Bounce outcome, with zero
  -- extra code needed here for the hazard case specifically.
  --
  -- Real side check added too (Showdown's own onAllyTryHitSide
  -- explicitly excludes an ally's own move from bouncing, only an
  -- OPPONENT's move bounces) -- this engine's own real N-way
  -- battle:sideOf makes that check free to add correctly.
