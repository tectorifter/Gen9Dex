-- CONTRARY/SIMPLE's speed/accuracy/evasion half -- their attack/defense/
-- spa/spd half is a direct edit inside combat/modern_combat.lua's own
-- changeStage (see that function's own comment). This file covers the
-- one other real path a stat stage change can take in this engine: Gen
-- 2's native Battle:changeStageAgainstMist, which switchin_stat_change
-- .lua's NATIVE_STATS branch and modern_movepool_stages.lua's
-- changeNativeStage both route speed/accuracy/evasion through directly,
-- bypassing modern_combat.lua's changeStage (and its own Substitute
-- check) entirely -- a real, pre-existing split this mod's own code
-- already documents in several places, not something introduced here.
--
-- Reimplements the native Mist gate inline (self-contained monkeypatch,
-- never edits gen1recomp-dev's own source) rather than pre-transforming
-- `stages` before delegating to the native function: Mist must still
-- evaluate the RAW, originally-intended sign (a hostile decrease should
-- still be blocked even if the holder also has Contrary) before
-- Contrary/Simple's own transform is applied to what actually lands.
