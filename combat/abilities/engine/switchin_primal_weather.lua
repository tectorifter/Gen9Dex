-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/primal_weather_switchin.lua
-- (Desolate Land, Primordial Sea, Delta Stream) -- Phase 1.5, explicitly
-- scoped by the user as its own phase separate from Phase 1's plain
-- weather abilities (Drizzle/Drought/Snow Warning/Orichalcum Pulse,
-- abilities/engine/switchin_weather.lua), because the real mechanic
-- genuinely differs in three ways plain weather doesn't have at all:
--
-- 1. Irreplaceable except by one of the other two primals -- gated at
--    every weather-setting call site via modern_combat.lua's own
--    mod.exports.canSetWeather(battle, isPrimalSource), added alongside
--    setWeather for this phase. A plain move/ability can never override
--    an active primal; a primal always overrides whatever was there
--    (including another primal), matching real Groudon-replaces-Kyogre
--    behavior.
-- 2. Indefinite duration, no 5/8-turn countdown -- battle.weatherTurns is
--    set to math.huge rather than run through field_duration.lua's own
--    resolveFieldDuration at all (there is no held-item extension for a
--    duration that never ends anyway). Native Gen 2 tickWeather still
--    decrements this every turn (gen2/Battle.lua:4381-4392) -- harmless,
--    since math.huge - 1 stays math.huge in Lua's own floating point, so
--    the <= 0 expiry branch is never reached. Its own per-turn flavor
--    message (Effects.WEATHER_TURN_TEXT[self.weather]) has no "strongwinds"
--    entry, same pre-existing gap this mod's own SNOW value already has
--    (Effects.lua only defines rain/sun/sandstorm) -- not a regression
--    introduced here, and out of this phase's scope to fix for either.
-- 3. Ends when the setting Pokemon leaves the field (switches out OR is
--    replaced after fainting), not on a timer -- battle.weatherPrimalSetter
--    tracks who's holding it; battle.battler_switched's own `previous`
--    field (confirmed real at every one of Battle:switch's three call
--    sites, gen2/Battle.lua) fires for both cases identically, so one
--    listener covers both.
--
-- DESOLATELAND/PRIMORDIALSEA are still real national_dex kind=
-- "set_weather" records (weather="sun"/"rain") -- read live via
-- abilityBehaviorOf exactly like Phase 1's plain weather abilities, same
-- WEATHER_KEY convention. DELTASTREAM's own record is kind="other"
-- (confirmed by direct read: its weather value, "a mysterious air
-- current," isn't in national_dex's own weather vocabulary at all) --
-- STRONGWINDS is hardcoded here as the one genuinely new (non-duplicated)
-- value this file introduces, consistent with "if the label doesn't
-- exist, we make our own."
--
-- Move-fail gate: Desolate Land blocks damaging Water-type moves,
-- Primordial Sea blocks damaging Fire-type moves, both via a Battle:
-- useMove wrap that skips the native call entirely on a block -- same
-- established simplification modern_terrain.lua's own Psychic Terrain
-- block already uses (no PP cost, no "used MOVE!" line; see that file's
-- own header for why this project accepts that as a real, simpler
-- behavior rather than the exact PS mechanic). Sun/rain's own existing
-- Fire/Water damage BOOST (modern_combat.lua's weather registerDamageModifier
-- entry) already applies for free to the extreme versions too, since they
-- share the plain SUN/RAIN weather value -- real Showdown behavior, not
-- something this file needs to add separately.
--
-- Delta Stream's own type-effectiveness cap: exports
-- mod.exports.effectivenessOverrideFor, consumed by modern_combat.lua's
-- own computeModernDamage at the one point in the formula that can
-- express "replace the type multiplier" rather than "add another factor
-- on top of it" -- see that file's own header comment at the call site.
