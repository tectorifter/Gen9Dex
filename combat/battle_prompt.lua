-- Two-choice in-battle prompt -- a PRIMITIVE any mod can raise, deliberately
-- not a policy. The caller supplies the question, the two labels and a
-- callback; nothing in this file knows or cares WHICH species, HP threshold,
-- trainer class or story flag made the question worth asking. Baking one
-- mod's trigger rule in here would impose that rule on every other consumer
-- of this mod, which is exactly the mistake the base engine already made and
-- that this file exists to work around (see the next paragraph). The
-- motivating case -- a boss at 1 HP offering "CATCH it" / "LEAVE it", both
-- answers ending the battle -- is implementable entirely as a caller: a
-- battle.damage/battle.fainted listener that checks its own condition and
-- calls askBattleChoice with its own two labels and its own callback. That
-- caller is NOT in this file, on purpose.
--
-- Why this has to be a mod-side reimplementation rather than "just set a
-- phase". Confirmed by direct engine source read before writing this, not
-- assumed: Gen 2's yes/no box is drawn only for a hardcoded list of five
-- phase names (src/ui/gen2/BattleState.lua:3822-3824, `local asking =
-- self.phase == "ask-nickname" or ... or self.phase == "ask-next-mon"`),
-- and each of those five phases has its own hand-rolled input branch in
-- :update (:2320 ask-nickname, :2356 ask-shift, :2377 ask-next-mon, :2470
-- ask-forget/stop-learning) hard-wired to its own answer handler
-- (:answerNickname, :openShiftParty, :answerUseNextMon,
-- :answerForgetPrompt). There is no phase-agnostic "ask a question" path,
-- and there is no input hook on the battle screen at all -- the engine's
-- nine battle.* hook names are accuracy, crit, damage, ended, fainted,
-- overlay, run, started, style (grepped the whole engine src/ tree), of
-- which exactly one (overlay) touches the battle screen and it is
-- draw-only.
--
-- Worse, a phase name the engine does not know is not merely undrawn: it is
-- unhandled. :update (src/ui/gen2/BattleState.lua:2113-2528) is a flat chain
-- of `if self.phase == "..." then ... return end` blocks with NO trailing
-- else -- an unrecognised phase falls off the end of the function every
-- frame, reading no input and advancing no queue, i.e. a hard softlock with
-- the message box still on screen. Everything below is built around that one
-- fact: this file's own phase name must never be visible to native :update,
-- and if one ever is (a save/load across a version change, a mod poking
-- .phase directly, this file's own bug) it must be recovered from rather
-- than sat in. See the watchdog in the update wrap.
--
-- REJECTED, and why:
--   * Patching the engine's `asking` list / adding an engine-side prompt
--     API. Correct long-term fix, wrong repo -- this is a mod and cannot
--     ship base-engine changes. Worth raising upstream separately; the
--     shape below is a reasonable sketch of what that API would look like.
--   * Reusing one of the engine's five existing ask-* phases. They are not
--     inert containers: answering "ask-shift" runs :openShiftParty, and
--     "ask-nickname" runs :answerNickname on the mon in .nicknameMon. A
--     borrowed phase means the engine's own handler fires on our answer.
--   * Driving the whole thing from battle.overlay. Overlay is draw-only and
--     fires inside :drawScene (:3876-3886), after the scene composites --
--     right for the BOX, useless for the ANSWER. Input has to be a class
--     wrap on :update, the same conclusion combat/move_availability_gate.lua
--     reached for the same reason (its own header, :15-24).
--   * A separate pushed screen (Screens.push, the way :openParty and
--     :openShiftParty open the party list). A real screen would need
--     registering in the engine's own screen table, and it suspends the
--     battle state's draw entirely. The cart's own yes/no box is five tiles
--     tall and sits OVER the battle (PlaceYesNoBox, home/menu.asm:392-410);
--     covering the whole field to ask one question is a bigger behaviour
--     change than the feature.
--   * Living inside combat/boss_fight.lua. Checked, and it does not belong
--     there: that file is a pure flag-set policy layer (setBossFightProtections
--     / bossFightHas) with no UI, no engine-class wrap and no per-frame code
--     at all, and its flags are boss-specific by definition. This primitive
--     is neither boss-specific nor policy. The boss capture case is a
--     CONSUMER of this file, not a reason to merge the two.
--
-- Gen 1 (src/battle/BattleState.lua) is deliberately NOT covered here. It has
-- no yes/no infrastructure whatsoever -- no PlaceYesNoBox equivalent, no
-- two-choice box in its drawTextArea, no ask-* phase of any kind (grepped:
-- its phases are menu/moveSelect/messages/... with no prompt among them), so
-- Gen 2's "reuse the box the engine already draws for five other questions"
-- shortcut has no counterpart there: it would mean drawing a box, a cursor
-- and two rows from scratch against a different font/chrome stack. This
-- mod's manifest is `"games": ["gen2"]` and the target is Crystal, so a
-- half-built Gen 1 arm would be untested surface, not coverage. It is a
-- follow-up, not a silent omission -- askBattleChoice returns false with a
-- reason on a Gen 1 boot rather than pretending.
