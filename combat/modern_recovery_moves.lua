-- Missing-effects plan, Phase 16: the recovery-move family
-- (HEALORDER, MILKDRINK, SLACKOFF, ROOST, AQUARING). Verified against
-- Showdown's own real source this pass (data/moves.ts's own records plus
-- battle-actions.ts:1198-1222, the move-resolution handler that actually
-- runs `moveData.heal`), not from memory.
--
--   HEALORDER / MILKDRINK / SLACKOFF -- a plain `heal: [1, 2]` self-move,
--     half of max HP, nothing else. national_dex gives all three
--     gen1Effect = "HEAL_EFFECT" / gen2Effect = "EFFECT_HEAL" with
--     gen1EffectModeled = gen2EffectModeled = true, and this engine's own
--     heal primitives (MoveEffects.lua's HEAL_EFFECT, gen2-Battle.lua's
--     EFFECT_HEAL) already split on move id and heal exactly
--     floor(maxHp / 2) for every move that is not Rest. They are
--     therefore ALREADY COMPLETE on both generations -- the plan's own
--     premise that all five "are not caught by the generic listener" was
--     wrong for these three. Nothing is repointed for them here
--     (re-registering an already-working native handler is pure risk for
--     no behavioral gain); they are recorded as native-covered in
--     combat/NATIVE_COVERAGE.md instead.
--
--   ROOST -- `heal: [1, 2]` PLUS `self: { volatileStatus: 'roost' }`,
--     whose condition has `duration: 1` and an `onType` that filters
--     FLYING out of the user's own types until the end of the turn. The
--     heal half is native and correct; the type-drop half was not
--     modelled anywhere. The move is repointed here at
--     GALAR_ROOST_EFFECT so both halves resolve in one handler.
--
--   AQUARING -- NO native effect at all (gen1Effect =
--     "NO_ADDITIONAL_EFFECT", gen1EffectModeled = false, gen2Effect =
--     "EFFECT_NORMAL_HIT", gen2EffectModeled = false), so this one was
--     genuinely missing. Real shape: `volatileStatus: 'aquaring'`,
--     self-target, condition onResidualOrder 6, `this.heal(pokemon
--     .baseMaxhp / 16)` every turn (1/16 max HP), ending on switch-out
--     but PASSED by Baton Pass.
--
-- Showdown's own ordering matters for Roost, and this file matches it
-- literally (battle-actions.ts:1201): the `moveData.heal` block runs
-- FIRST, and when the target is already at full HP it emits `-fail`,
-- sets `damage[i] = false`, `didAnything = null` and `continue`s --
-- skipping every later block, the `self` volatile included. So a
-- full-HP Roost FAILS and does NOT drop the Flying type. Both halves are
-- gated on the same condition below.
--
-- The Roost type drop is modelled at the one seam combat/modern_combat
-- .lua's resolvedTypeMult already exposes for exactly this question --
-- mod.exports.defensiveTypesOf, the hook combat/modern_tera.lua installed
-- for its Stellar override. It is WRAPPED, never replaced: the previous
-- implementation still runs first, so a Stellar Terastallization answer is
-- computed exactly as before and the FLYING filter is only layered on top.
-- This is the correct seam for Roost's real mechanic because the drop is a
-- purely DEFENSIVE change (an incoming move's type effectiveness): a mon
-- that uses Roost spends its own action doing it and cannot attack again
-- before the turn ends, so its own STAB never observes the drop. Because
-- resolvedTypeMult is reached through the unconditional battle.damage wrap
-- that IS every battle's damage path on both generations (modern_combat
-- .lua's own "this formula is the only damage path" header), the filter
-- works on Gen 1 and Gen 2 alike -- unlike combat/type_override_
-- primitives.lua's stored-type mutation, which is deliberately Gen 2 only.
--
-- Honest partial (documented, not faked): Aqua Ring's own "passed on by
-- Baton Pass" half is not modelled -- Baton Pass has no handler in this
-- mod yet (it is missing-effects plan PHASE 20). Switch-out and battle-end
-- both clear the ring, which is the half combat/status_condition_cleanup
-- .lua owns (see its own SWITCH_SCOPED list).
