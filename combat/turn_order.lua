-- Turn order: Generation 9 / Pokemon Showdown-accurate action sequencing,
-- owned entirely by this mod -- "we are the bible and process of combat"
-- applies here the same as everywhere else in combat/. Replaces
-- gen2/Battle.lua's own native comparator (priority from a small Gen-2
-- effect table with no Trick Room concept, then Quick Claw, then raw
-- Speed, then a coin-flip tie) through the engine's own sanctioned
-- extension point.
--
-- SOURCES, for the mechanic itself (verified 2026-08-20 against primary
-- sources, not assumed or taken from a single search summary -- the
-- first search this session returned the WRONG, outdated rule):
-- - https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/pull/6100 -- "Dynamic
--   speed updates for Gen 8," the actual Pokemon Showdown PR that
--   introduced re-sorting the remaining action queue by CURRENT speed
--   after each action resolves. Standing behavior through Gen 9.
--   Confirms Gen 7 and earlier computed order once at turn start and
--   never revisited it -- the older rule most casual sources describe.
-- - https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/250090/what-happens-if-there-is-speed-change-in-the-middle-of-a-turn
--   -- the pre-Gen-8 rule, for contrast; this is what a naive search
--   turns up first and is easy to mistake for the current rule.
-- - https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/User:FIQ/Turn_sequence --
--   the exact Speed calculation formula (stat-stage multiplier,
--   paralysis's 2048/4096 factor as of Gen 7+).
-- - https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Priority -- priority
--   bracket / Speed-tiebreak general reference.
--
-- SCOPE, stated plainly: this file owns the STRUCTURAL comparator --
-- priority bracket, Trick-Room-aware Speed compare, random tie-break --
-- generically over an arbitrary list of actors. It does NOT compute
-- effective Speed itself (stat stages, paralysis, item/ability speed
-- multipliers like Choice Scarf or Swift Swim, or ability-based priority
-- like Prankster) -- that is a separate, much larger body of work
-- (dozens of items/abilities), out of scope here. Callers pass in
-- already-resolved speed/priority numbers; this file only decides ORDER
-- given those numbers. Today's one real caller (the battle.turn_order
-- wrap below) reuses the engine's own native Battle:effectiveSpeed and
-- Battle:movePriority. Battle:movePriority was a real, confirmed bug --
-- it read ONLY a small legacy table keyed by native effect id (Quick
-- Attack/Protect/Counter/etc.), silently treating every move outside that
-- legacy list as priority 0 and falling through to a raw Speed compare.
--
-- PRIORITY'S OWNER (explicit user rule, 2026-09-10): national_dex is the
-- absolute owner of a move's priority property; this engine only CONSUMES
-- it, never authors or overrides it. So movePriority now reads priority
-- from national_dex's own moveById(moveId) reply FIRST (cached per move
-- id below). That reply is authoritative for every move national_dex has
-- a record for, which is exactly the set of real moves.
--
-- WHY THE OLD PATHS COULDN'T BE TRUSTED (the reported Protect bug): the
-- live engine record (self:moveDef) is the CART's own gen2 record for a
-- move the cart already shipped. national_dex deliberately leaves such a
-- record ALONE rather than re-registering it (mod/src/moves.lua: "A move
-- the running cart already describes is left ALONE, not overridden"), so
-- that live record has NO `priority` field at all. This engine then repoints
-- several of those same moves' `effect` at its own handlers (e.g.
-- modern_combat_protect.lua patches PROTECT/DETECT onto GMAX_PROTECT_EFFECT),
-- which also defeats the legacy Battle.PRIORITY[effect] table -- so both
-- fallbacks missed and priority silently became 0. Reading national_dex's
-- own record sidesteps all of that: national_dex knows PROTECT is +4
-- regardless of what the cart record or the live effect id happen to be.
--
-- The two legacy paths are kept ONLY as a fallback for a move that
-- national_dex has no record for at all -- e.g. an engine-synthetic id like
-- BATTLE_FORMS_MAXGUARD. This mod stays self-contained -- gen1recomp-dev's
-- own source is never edited -- so the fix is a monkeypatch of
-- Battle.movePriority itself, right below, not an engine change.
-- effectiveSpeed's own accuracy (item/ability speed multipliers,
-- Prankster-style ability priority) remains genuinely out of scope, per
-- the paragraph above.
--
-- Trick Room is accepted as an input flag (opts.trickRoom), not
-- something this file activates or tracks -- combat/trick_room.lua owns
-- the real move effect (a real 5-turn activation, -7 priority, toggle-off
-- on reuse, confirmed against Bulbapedia) and writes the
-- battle.trickRoomActive field the wiring below reads. Kept as two
-- separate files on purpose: this one only ever needs to know the
-- CURRENT value of that flag, never how or when it gets set.
--
-- MULTI-BATTLER READINESS: see combat/MULTI_BATTLE_HOOKS.md for the real
-- contract. computeTurnOrder below is an INTERNAL PRIMITIVE, not the
-- integration point -- a future multi-battler mod should not call it
-- directly, since that would mean it derives priority/Speed/Trick-Room/
-- RNG itself, exactly the caller-side computation that doc's contract
-- exists to avoid. The actual seam is mod.exports.resolveTurnActions
-- (not yet built, spec'd in that doc) -- hand it battler identity only,
-- it derives everything else the same way this file's own
-- battle.turn_order wiring already does below. computeTurnOrder itself
-- IS already generic over N actors on either side, including asymmetric
-- formats (4v1, 1v5, 4vN) -- a flat list, no concept of "sides" anywhere
-- in it -- which is what makes it the right primitive for
-- resolveTurnActions to be built on. What is NOT yet possible is calling
-- it more than once per turn (a genuine mid-turn re-sort, matching PR
-- #6100 exactly) -- gen2/Battle.lua's own turn-resolution loop is a
-- hard-coded two-branch call with no second extension point between the
-- two actions, and nothing beyond 2 actors exists in this engine's data
-- model at all. Both are real engine-level gaps, not something reachable
-- from mod code as it stands -- see MULTI_BATTLE_HOOKS.md for the full
-- explanation and what a future multi-battler mod would need to bring.

  -- Real bug fix, monkeypatched rather than edited into the engine (see

  -- explicit user rule -- so the resolution order is:
  --   1. national_dex's own moveById(moveId).priority, when that mod has a
  --      record for the move AND carries a numeric priority field. This is
  --      the authoritative answer for every real move. It is what makes
  --      PROTECT (+4), DETECT (+4), QUICK_ATTACK (+1), COUNTER (-5),
  --      MIRRORCOAT (-5), TRICKROOM (-7) etc. actually order correctly.
  --   2. Otherwise (no national_dex record -- e.g. an engine-synthetic id
  --      like BATTLE_FORMS_MAXGUARD -- or a record without a priority
  --      field): the live record's own def.priority if it carries one, then
  --      the legacy Battle.PRIORITY[def.effect] table, then 0.
  -- The old code ONLY did (2), which is exactly why the cart moves broke:
  -- national_dex leaves a cart-registered move's record alone (so the live
  -- record has no priority field), and this engine repoints several of
  -- those moves' `effect` at its own handlers, so Battle.PRIORITY missed
  -- too -- 0, then a raw Speed compare. national_dex's reply is unaffected
  -- by either.
  --
  -- The reply is cached per move id: moveById deep-copies its record on
  -- every call, and priority is a static property of the move (caster-
  -- dependent modifiers are applied separately, below), so re-reading it
  -- every turn would be pure waste.
  --
  -- Phase 5 (abilities/engine/priority_change.lua): registerPriorityModifier
  -- -- the same composable-chain shape registerDamageModifier already is
  -- (combat/modern_combat.lua), just for priority instead of damage.
  -- `caster` is a NEW, OPTIONAL 2nd param -- every existing call site
  -- (this file's own resolveTurnActions/battle.turn_order wrap below, plus
  -- combat/modern_terrain.lua's Psychic Terrain block) now passes it, but
  -- it defaults to nil for any other caller (e.g. tests/
  -- gen2_battle_ui_test.lua's own direct calls), which simply skips every

  -- GEN 1 TURN RESOLUTION -- the engine owns turn order on Gen 1 too.
  --
  -- THE GAP THIS CLOSES. g9-Battle-Scene's Gen-1 backend (native.lua)
  -- resolves a turn natively: it insertion-sorts the queued actions with the
  -- game's own src/battle/TurnOrder.firstMover and executes each with
  -- BattleState:performMove. Its header states the contract -- a
  -- gen-1-capable engine mod "takes over by exporting
  -- resolveTurnActionsForGen1(battle, acting), checked first" -- and the
  -- scene genuinely calls it (native.lua:790-795). Until now this engine
  -- never exported it, so EVERY priority rule this engine owns was silently
  -- Gen-2-only on Gen 1: Battle:movePriority above is installed only
  -- `if Battle` and there is no Gen-2 Battle class on a Gen-1 boot, so
  -- national_dex's authoritative priority and the whole
  -- registerPriorityModifier chain (Prankster/Gale Wings/Triage, Stall/Quick
  -- Draw/Mycelium Might, Grassy Glide) were never consulted. Native ordering
  -- read only the cart's own move record (`move.priority`, else the two
  -- native entries QUICK_ATTACK/COUNTER).
  --
  -- WHAT THIS OWNS. The ORDER DECISION only -- which actor acts first, given
  -- priority and effective Speed -- exactly the scope the Gen-2
  -- resolveTurnActions has. It does NOT reimplement a move: every action is
  -- executed through the scene's own `battle:useMove(mon, target, moveId)`
  -- (native BattleState:performMove -- accuracy, damage, effects, status, PP,
  -- the real thing), the same "call the native primitive" discipline the
  -- scene already applies to catch/EXP. The scene drains battle:takeEvents()
  -- itself after this returns, so this never touches the event queue.
  --
  -- PER-ACTOR COMPOSITION:
  --   priority = priorityWithModifiers (national_dex first; fallback = the
  --     actor's own native move record + the two Gen-1 native entries) plus
  --     the Gen-1 fractional ITEM offset -- Quick Claw +0.1, Lagging Tail /
  --     Full Incense -0.1 -- via combat/modern_gen1_held_items.lua's own
  --     exported helper, rolled once per actor for the turn. The modifier
  --     chain is the SAME one Gen 2 consumes, so ability priority orders
  --     Gen-1 turns identically. (The Gen-2 `lagging_tail` modifier reads the
  --     Gen-2 item slot and so returns 0 here; the native fractional helper
  --     is what covers Gen 1 -- no double count.)
  --   speed = the game's OWN native effective Speed
  --     (src/battle/TurnOrder.effectiveSpeed: stat stages, badge boost,
  --     status penalty, and -- because modern_gen1_held_items.lua replaces
  --     that module field -- Choice Scarf / Quick Powder / Iron Ball). Read
  --     LAZILY, at call time, never captured at load time: turn_order boots
  --     before modern_gen1_held_items installs that patch, so a load-time
  --     capture would silently read the un-patched speed.
  --
  -- ORDERING: computeTurnOrder -- the same primitive, RNG tie-break and
  -- Trick-Room reversal the Gen-2 path uses, so 1v1 and any future N-actor
  -- format are provably one algorithm.
  --
  -- `caster` handed to every priority modifier is the RAW MON (action.mon),
  -- never the Gen-1 battler wrapper: abilityIdOf reads mon.ability and a
  -- Gen-1 wrapper has no ability of its own (src/battle/BattleState.lua:588
  -- makeBattler -- confirmed; the exact trap combat/modern_items.lua's own
  -- heldAbilityIdOf exists to avoid). itemOf unwraps `.mon` on its own, so
  -- item-reading modifiers still work when handed either.

  -- target, with what move -- and we derive priority/Speed/Trick-Room/
  -- RNG order ourselves and drive battle:useMove(...) directly, per
  -- battler, in our own correctly-derived order. This deliberately never
  -- touches battle:takeTurn/runTurn (confirmed unexported, unwrappable,
  -- hard-coded to battle.player/battle.enemy) -- useMove itself is
  -- confirmed generic over attacker/defender (Battle.lua:1337 reads
  -- self:findMove(attacker,...)/self:volatile(attacker)/
  -- self:sideOf(attacker), never battle.player/battle.enemy directly),
  -- so any battler this caller controls flows through the real pipeline
  -- (STAB/Tera/Protect/Max Guard/every registerDamageModifier) exactly
  -- like today's player-vs-enemy fights, with zero new wiring needed on
  -- the damage side.
  --
  -- actingBattlers: a flat list, any length, either side --
  --   { { mon = <real mon table>, move = <moveId>, target = <real mon> },
  --     ... }
  -- `target` is the single chosen mon as of QUEUE time. If an earlier
  -- action this turn faints it, THIS function redirects/fails that action
  -- itself (see the ROUND 26 note below) -- the caller never has to
  -- pre-check aliveness, exactly the mid-turn knowledge update
  -- MULTI_BATTLE_HOOKS.md's own contract puts on this side of the seam.
  --
  -- SPEED, deliberately NOT read via battle:effectiveSpeed(mon): that
  -- method computes self.stages[self:sideOf(mon)] (Battle.lua:845-848),
  -- and sideOf is a hard binary -- `(mon == self.player) and "player" or
  -- "enemy"` (Battle.lua:434-436) -- so every battler that isn't
  -- literally battle.player or battle.enemy would silently share ONE
  -- stage bucket with whichever side it falls through to, corrupting
  -- stat-stage boosts across unrelated battlers the instant a real
  -- (3+ total battlers) format is used. Confirmed by direct read, not
  -- assumed -- this is exactly the class of gap MULTI_BATTLE_HOOKS.md's
  -- own "no real N-way sideOf" section warns about, one level deeper
  -- than the event-tagging case that doc calls out by name. Speed here
  -- instead composes battle:battleStat(mon,"speed") (genuinely per-mon,
  -- confirmed safe -- Battle.lua:762-764's only mon-identity check is a
  -- `mon == self.player` badge-boost gate, which is real Gen 2 behavior:
  -- badges only ever boost the human player's own team, correct for any

  -- its move to a 0-HP corpse: a second attack landing on an already-

  -- The real rule (the user's own explicit spec) is decided by the fainted

  --     has no alternate recipient at all -- it simply FAILS, spending its
  --     PP and announcing itself exactly like any other failed move, and
  --     never touching the fainted ally.
  -- Spread moves are deliberately untouched: resolveMoveTargets already

  -- that name, not which engine registered it -- so this wrap fires for
  -- Gen 1 battles too the instant it's installed. Gen 1's own call passes
  -- a completely different ctx shape (`{ rng = self.rng }`, confirmed by
  -- direct read -- no .battle field at all), so `local battle = ctx.battle`
  -- silently evaluated to nil and every following battle: call crashed
  -- (attempt to index a nil value) on the first turn of any Gen 1 battle.
  -- Gen 1 does not get Gen-9-accurate turn order from this file at all
  -- yet (that's real, separate work, not yet built) -- this guard only
  -- stops the crash by falling through to Gen 1's own native comparator
  -- (nextFn) whenever ctx doesn't look like Gen 2's own shape.
