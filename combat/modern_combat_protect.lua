-- Protect move logic: genuine greenfield work (confirmed by grepping all of
-- src/battle/ for "protect"/"Protect"/"Detect" -- only unrelated Mist/Light
-- Screen flavor text exists; Gen 1's original ROM never had Protect at all,
-- it was introduced Gen 2).
--
-- DUAL-ENGINE file (2026-09-16, round 169). This mod's manifest declares
-- "games": ["gen1", "gen2"], so everything here has to run on BOTH. It
-- was originally written against gen2/Battle.lua's own API only (an
-- earlier header here wrongly claimed a gen2-only manifest), which is a
-- real, confirmed bug: gen2/Battle.lua:1533-1538 is the only dispatch
-- site for a move's registered effect record, reading `effectRecord.run`
-- called positionally as `run(self, attacker, defender, def, moveId,
-- sureHit)` and IGNORING the return value -- while gen1's
-- BattleState:performMove (:4350-4377) calls the SAME record as
-- `record.run(ctx)` with ONE ctx table and prints the RETURNED message
-- array. Under gen 1 the old gen2-shaped handlers therefore received the
-- ctx as `battle` and nil as `user`, crashing at rollStall's
-- `user.protectChainTurn` (the reported "attempt to index local 'user'"
-- at line 122) the instant Protect was used. Every handler below is now
-- dual via the local ctxOf() normalizer: it returns a message list on gen
-- 1 and emits via battle:emit on gen 2. Gen 1 also lacks battle.turn and
-- battle:roller (it has turnCount and battle.rng(a,b), no roller), so the
-- stall chain reads whichever field each engine actually has.
--
-- The earlier fix's own reasoning (record.run, not a non-existent
-- `.perform`, and not kind="full") still holds on both engines -- the
-- move_effects schema (src/mods/Schemas.lua:1280-1288) defines neither,
-- and both engines dispatch kind="primary" records through `run`.
--
-- Part A: PROTECT already exists in this mod's own data
-- (GalarGmaxDex/moves_new.lua, priority = 4, correct already) as a
-- documented no-op (effect = "NO_ADDITIONAL_EFFECT", functionCode =
-- "ProtectUser" -- functionCode is dead documentation, grepped: nothing in
-- the core engine ever reads it). Registered here as a real move_effects
-- record (kind = "primary", a `run` handler in Gen 2's own calling
-- convention -- the same shape modern_hazards.lua's GALAR_STEALTHROCK_
-- EFFECT/GALAR_TOXICSPIKES_EFFECT already use successfully) and patched
-- onto PROTECT. Effect records are keyed by move id, so this applies
-- identically in wild, trainer, and link battles with no extra wiring --
-- and any future Detect/Endure/Spiky Shield/Baneful Bunker/King's Shield
-- can point their own `effect` field at this exact same id (they're
-- mechanically identical decay chains in every real generation).
--
-- Success-chance formula deliberately stays the modern Showdown "stall"
-- decay (1/3 per consecutive use, capped 1/729) rather than switching to
-- Gen 2's own native halving chain (Effects.protectSucceeds, the formula
-- Battle.MOVE_EFFECTS.EFFECT_PROTECT already uses natively) -- an earlier,
-- separate, already-explained design choice this fix doesn't revisit; only
-- the dispatch/messaging plumbing was actually broken.
--
-- Part B: blocking an INCOMING damaging move against a protected target.
--
-- Wraps battle.damage (the same hook modern_combat.lua already uses) at a
-- HIGHER priority, so it runs first in the chain and can short-circuit
-- straight to typeMult = 0 without ever calling next() -- reusing Gen 2's
-- own existing, already-correct handling for that exact value (confirmed
-- by direct read, gen2/Battle.lua:1124-1140:
-- `normalizeDamageInfo` maps `typeMult` onto `info.effectiveness`, and
-- `if info.effectiveness == 0 then ... "It doesn't affect %s..." ... end`
-- short-circuits before dealDamage is ever called). Same code path a type
-- immunity already uses, so no new message logic is needed here at all --
-- PP/animation/announcement all run completely normally through the
-- untouched native useMove, and only the damage number comes back zeroed.
--
-- Part D: blocking an INCOMING pure status move (Thunder Wave, Toxic, a
-- stat-lowering move) against a protected target -- these never call
-- hitOnce/battle.damage at all, so Part B's hook never sees them. No hook
-- exists for "a primary status effect is about to run" the way
-- battle.damage does for damage, so this wraps Battle:useMove itself --
-- but NOT the naive "block before native runs at all" version: that would
-- skip PP decrement and the "X used Y!" announcement, giving the attacker
-- their move back for free, which is wrong (a Protect-blocked move still
-- costs PP and still gets announced in every real generation, exactly
-- like Part B's reasoning for damaging moves).
--
-- Instead, when the block condition is met, this temporarily swaps
-- Battle.moveEffectRecordFor (gen2/Battle.lua:2703's own lookup function,
-- a plain function on the class table, not per-instance -- the same
-- monkeypatch shape modern_hazards.lua's own header cites this file as
-- having established) for the single native useMove call, substituting a
-- "doesn't affect" stand-in record -- so native's PP/announcement/
-- accuracy-roll logic (useMove's own top half) runs completely unmodified
-- and unduplicated, and only the real record.run(...) that would have
-- applied the effect is swapped out. Restored immediately after, even on
-- error.

  -- confirmed directly (src/mods/Loader.lua:1717 registry:freeze() runs
  -- BEFORE :1728's "mods.loaded" emit) that a mod.content.moves:patch
  -- call from a "mods.loaded" handler hits an already-frozen registry.
  -- A same-day attempt to defer this call there was reverted for exactly
  -- that reason -- it silently no-opped every time (Registry:patch on a
  -- frozen registry throws, and the event dispatcher's own protective
  -- pcall swallowed it with no visible error), confirmed by the Z-Move
  -- heuristic's own patched-count dropping from a real number to 0 and
  -- this block's own diagnostic never printing at all.
  --
  -- The real fix for battle_forms's load order is `battle_forms` now
  -- listed in THIS mod's own manifest.json optional_dependencies (see
  -- that file) -- a real graph edge (Loader.lua:739-749) that makes
  -- battle_forms's entire entry function, including every move it
  -- registers, finish running before this mod's own entry function ever
  -- starts, regardless of the two mods' raw priority numbers. battle_forms
  -- ALSO lists this mod as ITS OWN optional dependency, so this creates a
  -- genuine two-mod cycle -- confirmed the loader breaks exactly this
  -- shape deliberately rather than failing (Loader.lua:766-774,
  -- "optional dependency loop broken at %s", alphabetically-first id
  -- wins) -- "battle_forms" sorts before "g9-battle-engine", so the

  -- chain (protectChainX/protectChainTurn) is stored directly on the
  -- mon's own persistent table, NOT a per-battle volatile -- confirmed
  -- the same real shape this whole session's own established knowledge
  -- already flags repeatedly (Gen 2 mon tables are the persistent party
  -- members, the SAME table across every battle that mon ever fights).
  -- Real Showdown's own equivalent ("stall") is a genuine per-BATTLE
  -- volatile that clears automatically on switch-out and never exists
  -- at all in a fresh battle -- this mod's own fields had no such
  -- clearing anywhere (confirmed, grepped every reference to both
  -- fields in this whole mod: only ever read/written inside this same
  -- file's own two run() handlers above, never reset elsewhere), so a
  -- mon that had decayed down to 1/9 or lower stayed decayed forever
  -- after switching out and back in, or even into a LATER, completely
  -- separate battle -- exactly the reported symptom, "never restores
  -- 100%." Fixed the same real way modern_items.lua's own Ripen/Cheek
  -- Pouch state (ggdLastConsumedItem/ggdConsumedBerryThisBattle) already
  -- resets: on `battle.started` for the WHOLE party (every mon that
  -- might switch in fresh, not just the two currently active) and on
  -- `battle.battler_switched` for whichever mon just left (`ev.previous`
  -- -- the same real field Natural Cure/Regenerator already read for an
  -- identical "the mon that just left" need).

  -- Part E: Z-Moves bypass Protect/Max Guard entirely, same as Feint --
  -- explicit user spec. Unlike Feint (a fixed id already carrying
  -- bypassesProtect = true in this mod's own moves_new.lua), Z-Moves are
  -- ~100 individually-registered ids owned entirely by battle_forms, with
  -- no shared marker field on the registered record to test (confirmed
  -- by reading battle_forms/src/zmoves.lua and speciesz.lua's own
  -- mod.content.moves:register calls directly -- id/name/type/power/
  -- accuracy/pp/effect only, nothing like a `kind`/`zMove` flag) and no
  -- way to read battle_forms's own source data files to enumerate them
  -- properly (same sandboxing limit as isMaxMove above). Best-effort
  -- heuristic instead: every BATTLE_FORMS_-prefixed move that ISN'T a Max/
  -- G-Max move (isMaxMove above) and isn't a Tera Blast variant (a real,
  -- ordinary damaging move Tera just retypes, never Protect-exempt) gets
  -- the flag.
  --
  -- Confirmed bug, fixed here: this originally ran on "mods.loaded",
  -- reasoning that it needed to wait for battle_forms's own moves to be
  -- registered first. Direct read of src/mods/Loader.lua proved that
  -- reasoning backwards -- registry:freeze() (Loader.lua:1465) runs
  -- BEFORE "mods.loaded" is ever emitted (Loader.lua:1476), so every
  -- mod.content.moves:patch call in the original version was silently
  -- throwing "content is frozen after load" inside its own pcall, every
  -- single time -- this whole block was a no-op from the start. The real
  -- fix needs no event wait at all: mod loading is priority-ascending,
  -- ties broken by id (Loader.lua's own orderedIds/_order) -- confirmed
  -- battle_forms's manifest priority is 80, this mod's is 95, so
  -- battle_forms's entire entry function (including every move it
  -- registers) has already finished running by the time this mod's own
  -- entry function -- this line included -- starts. Runs synchronously,
  -- same as every other registration in this file. Logs exactly what it
