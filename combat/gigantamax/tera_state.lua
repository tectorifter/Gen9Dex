-- Tera Type storage + public API: per-mon read/modify, same shape and
-- reasoning as gigantamax/dynamax_state.lua's Dynamax Level/Gigantamax
-- Factor pair. We own this storage outright -- explicit user instruction
-- (2026-08-20): battle_forms's own "TERA TYPE" mod option (src/tera.lua)
-- is a placeholder built for testing before this API existed, and is
-- meant to be rewired to read from here later.
--
-- THAT REWIRING IS NOW IN PLACE, from our side -- round 8 (2026-09-06)
-- built the BATTLE_FORMS_STAMP mirror below; round 9 (2026-09-06) closed
-- the last two ways battle_forms could still decide a type itself (see
-- the OWNERSHIP GATE below). battle_forms resolves a Terastallization's
-- type as: its TERA TYPE option (if a concrete choice) -> its own
-- mon.battleFormsTeraType stamp (the field its Tera Orb shop writes) -> a
-- DVs-derived answer (src/teratype.lua). We keep that stamp equal to our
-- stored value, so with battle_forms' option reading as AUTO the stamp is
-- consulted first and OUR per-Pokemon stored type is the one its
-- activation actually deploys (writes into formTypes, announces, mirrors
-- back into mon.teraType as the same value). No battle_forms edit needed
-- -- this is the seam battle_forms itself documents as its per-mon
-- override. Per explicit user instruction ("battle forms should only keep
-- that dev power when enabled... everything else of tera is to be owned
-- by g9-battle-engine-beta"), battle_forms' TERA TYPE option no longer
-- overrides anything by default: it is forced to AUTO by ensureBattleFormsGate
-- (below) unless this mod's bf_tera_dev option is ON, and every active
-- battler is pre-stamped (modern_tera's ensureTeraStamps) so the
-- DVs-derived fallback is unreachable too -- battle_forms only reports
-- WHEN tera triggers; WHAT type deploys is always this mod's answer.
-- battle_forms' own activation flow (menu cell, once-per-battle registry
-- slot) is otherwise untouched. This file owns the STORED VALUE and now
-- the type battle_forms deploys; it still never decides when/how a
-- Terastallization triggers -- same ownership line already drawn for
-- Dynamax Level/Gigantamax Factor.
--
-- Stored as a bare `mon.teraType` field (a type id string, or nil for
-- "unset") -- schema-less save round-tripping, the identical pattern
-- `mon.gigantamaxFactor`/battle_forms's own `mon.battleFormsStone` already
-- rely on (src/mods/SaveSerializer.lua's generic table walk, confirmed
-- this session). Does NOT survive a real link-cable trade (a separate
-- allowlist wire protocol) unless moved under mon.extra -- not needed for
-- the currently scoped use.
--
-- STELLAR is a real, valid value here even though no chart record and no
-- battle_forms menu choice exists for it (src/tera.lua's own TERA_CHOICES
-- lists the 18 standard types only) -- see combat/modern_tera.lua's own
-- header for why Stellar structurally cannot be represented by
-- battle_forms's mechanism at all, and is this mod's own domain instead.

  -- OWNERSHIP GATE (round 9, 2026-09-06). Explicit user instruction: "battle

  -- when tera is triggered, everything else of tera is to be owned by
  -- g9-battle-engine-beta." battle_forms' own TERA TYPE manager option is its
  -- dev/test tool -- src/tera.lua reads it live at every activation via its
  -- deps.chosen() = mod.options:get("tera_type") and, when it is a concrete
  -- type, it overrides every Pokemon regardless of our stamp. This wraps that
  -- read on the battle_forms mod object itself (mod.find -- the same seam its

  -- thing battle_forms can see -- our stored type is the type it deploys. It
