-- Part B Phase 5, second batch: item-interaction moves -- Fling, Knock
-- Off, Covet, Incinerate, Bug Bite, Pluck, Recycle, Belch.
--
-- Primitives confirmed by direct source read before writing anything
-- (background research this session, then several follow-up checks):
--   Held item field: Gen 2 mons carry a real string item id directly on
--   the raw mon (`mon.item`, src/battle/gen2/Mon.lua:296). Gen 1 has no
--   native item field anywhere in the engine (`src/pokemon/Pokemon.lua`),
--   so this mod stores one in a save slot -- `mon.g9HeldItem`, owned by
--   combat/modern_held_item_api.lua (round 98) -- and every read/write
--   here goes through the gen-aware itemOf/setItemOf pair below. Round 99
--   made BOTH writers/readers generation-aware: before that, a stored Gen-1
--   item could be read by the modifiers but every remover wrote `mon.item`
--   (a Gen-2-only field), so item-removal moves were no-ops for Gen 1.
--   Reads/writes route through the API's effectiveHeldItemOf /
--   HELD_ITEM_SAVED_FIELD when it has booted, with the same inlined field
--   fallback so this file also behaves standalone.
--   Item removal: no dedicated function exists anywhere in the engine --
--   the only real precedent (Berserk Gene, gen2/Battle.lua:3434-3435) is
--   a plain field assignment. Same primitive, via setItemOf.
--   battle.damage_dealt: confirmed identical shape to modern_hazards.lua's
--   own use (battle, user, target, move/moveId, damage) -- fires only
--   AFTER a landed, non-immune hit, the correct point for "on-hit" item
--   side effects (Knock Off/Covet/Bug Bite/Pluck/Fling's own consumption).
--   battle.damage (mod.hooks:wrap, NOT mod.events:on): a genuine cross-gen
--   wrap-hook, confirmed via Runtime.call("battle.damage", ...) present
--   on BOTH BattleState.lua:2335 (Gen 1) and gen2/Battle.lua:1119 (Gen 2)
--   with matching (dmg, info) return shape. modern_combat_protect.lua's
--   own Part B already establishes the pattern this file reuses for a
--   genuine pre-damage FAIL (Fling/Incinerate/Belch's conditions): wrap
--   at a priority above modern_combat.lua's own formula hook (0) and
--   short-circuit to `0, {crit=false, typeMult=0}` without calling
--   next() -- reusing EffectRegistry.lua's/gen2 Battle.lua's own already-
--   correct zero-damage handling ("It doesn't affect %s!") rather than
--   building new fail-message plumbing. Real Fling/Incinerate/Belch show
--   "But it failed!" specifically, not that text -- a known, minor,
--   deliberate reuse of the existing generic path rather than new
--   infrastructure, same tradeoff Protect's own file already made.
--   registerPowerOverride / registerDamageModifier (both modern_combat.lua
--   exports): the real per-move variable-power and final-multiplier
--   chains (Flail/Power Trip/Heat Crash precedent for the former, STAB/
--   weather precedent for the latter) -- Fling's item-dependent power and
--   Knock Off's 1.5x-if-item-present boost use these, not a move_effects
--   .run (which would hit Gen 2's "any .run field preempts damage"
--   gotcha modern_hazards.lua's own header already documents).
--   held_item.trigger (Battle:heldEffect, gen2/Battle.lua:815-826): the
--   real, mod-hookable chokepoint every native held-item effect goes
--   through, including the end-of-turn HELD_BERRY auto-heal. Used here
--   (read-only, always passes its own effect/parameter through unchanged)
--   purely to learn WHEN the native residual tick is about to actually
--   consume a berry, so Recycle/Belch have real state to work from.
--
-- GEN-1 BOUNDARIES (honest, not faked): reads/writes/removal/messages all
-- work on Gen 1 through the item API. Two things stay Gen-2-only because
-- Gen 1 genuinely has no data for them: (1) Berry Juice's residual and the
-- held_item.trigger auto-eat (the Gen-1 Berry Juice tick lives in
-- combat/modern_gen1_held_items.lua instead); (2) Bug Bite/Pluck's berry
-- EFFECT -- Gen 1's BattleState has no `itemDef`, so the berry is still
-- eaten and the target still loses it, but no heal/cure is applied (the
-- same "no Gen-1 berry data" boundary modern_gen1_held_items.lua's header
-- records). Belch's ggdConsumedBerryThisBattle is set by Bug Bite/Pluck
-- on both generations (Showdown's own `source.ateBerry = true`).
