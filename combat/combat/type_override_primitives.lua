-- Type override: the generic "this mon's own current type changes mid-
-- battle" primitive -- Soak/Magic Powder/Burn Up/Double Shock/Conversion/
-- Reflect Type/Camouflage (moves, wired in combat/modern_type_change_moves
-- .lua) today; Protean/Libero/Color Change/Forecast (abilities) once this
-- engine has an ability system, per explicit user decision reusing the
-- SAME entrypoint. Distinct from Terastallization (combat/modern_tera.lua)
-- -- its own separately-owned, stable system -- this primitive never
-- touches Tera's own formTypes field or vice versa.
--
-- LABEL: "change_type" -- not invented here. national_dex's own ability
-- data (0.30.0+, dex.exports.abilityById) already tags Protean/Libero/
-- Color Change/Forecast/Multitype with exactly this kind in their own
-- `behaviour.effects[].kind` field (confirmed directly, fetched from the
-- real data, not assumed) -- reused verbatim per the explicit rule "if
-- there's no label... we make the label ourselves": here, one already
-- exists, so it is not remade. National Dex's own move data has no
-- structured kind vocabulary at all (moveById's effect/shortEffect are
-- free text only) -- there IS no label to reuse for the move side, so
-- move-triggered cases key off this same "change_type" string by our own
-- choice, for one consistent vocabulary across both sources, per that same
-- rule's other half.
--
-- STORAGE: mutates mon.types directly, Gen 2 only (this mod's own
-- established scope for a mechanic neither engine had natively --
-- trick_room.lua/modern_terrain.lua's own precedent) -- the exact same
-- field mod.exports.curTypesOf already reads as the "live type list" for
-- STAB and every type-effectiveness check (modern_combat.lua's own
-- confirmed convention: curTypesOf(who, true) = who.types, cited directly
-- against Gen 2's own native STAB check, gen2/Damage.lua:249-253).
--
-- RESET: real Pokemon Showdown resets a type override the instant
-- clearVolatile runs (confirmed directly, smogon/pokemon-showdown's own
-- sim/pokemon.ts: clearVolatile's own last line is `this.setSpecies(this.
-- baseSpecies)`, and setSpecies itself calls `this.setType(species.types,
-- true)` -- i.e. on every switch, both sides, unconditionally, the same
-- lifecycle point stat boosts/Substitute/etc. already reset on). This
-- engine's own Battle:clearVolatile is already called on every real switch
-- path in this mod (Battle:switch's own two calls, native EFFECT_
-- BATON_PASS's own call on the passer, native EFFECT_FORCE_SWITCH's own
-- call on the dragged-out defender, combat/switch_primitives.lua's own
-- switchMonAtSide) -- so wrapping that ONE method, rather than hooking
-- every individual switch path separately, is what makes reset-on-switch
-- correct everywhere for free, mirroring real PS's own architecture
-- exactly.

  -- The gate: whether `mon`'s own type is allowed to change right now.
  -- Explicit user rules, this session:
  --
  -- 1. TERASTALLIZATION: once a mon is Terastallized, its type can never
  --    be changed again this battle -- neither by its own move/ability
  --    (Protean/Libero/Conversion/Camouflage/Burn Up/Double Shock/Reflect
  --    Type's self side) nor by an opponent's move targeting it (Soak/
  --    Magic Powder). Checked via combat/modern_tera.lua's own
  --    isTerastallized (must load before this file).
  --
  --    SAME-TURN ORDERING with Protean/Libero, stated explicitly by the
  --    user and not re-derivable from this gate alone -- a future ability
  --    hook must call this gate (and setMonTypes) BEFORE the same turn's
  --    Tera activation happens, never after: "user first changes type,
  --    setting their new base type... then comes tera activation, lastly
  --    comes move resolution (stab applications)." Checking isTerastallized
  --    at trigger time already produces this correctly AS LONG AS the
  --    caller's own sequencing is right -- Tera genuinely isn't active yet
  --    at the moment Protean/Libero would fire on the turn a mon does
  --    both, so this gate reads false (allowed) at exactly the right
  --    moment. This gate cannot enforce call-order itself; it can only
  --    answer correctly if asked at the correct point.
  --
  --    Forecast follows the identical rule, generalized from "move
  --    selection" to "whatever triggers Forecast" (a weather change, from
  --    any mon's move, not just Castform's own): a weather change landing
  --    on the same turn Castform Terastallizes still updates its type/form
  --    before that turn's Tera activation, the same "changes lock in
  --    first, Tera comes after" ordering, not a separate case. Once
  --    Castform IS Terastallized, this gate blocks every later Forecast
  --    retrigger for the rest of the battle, same as it blocks Protean/
  --    Libero from firing again.
  --
  -- 2. DYNAMAX/GIGANTAMAX, asymmetric on purpose: a Dynamaxed/Gigantamaxed
  --    mon can still change ITS OWN type (Protean/Libero keep working --
  --    Soak/Camouflage/etc. used BY a Dynamaxed mon are moot rather than
  --    blocked, since every one of its own status moves is substituted
  --    into Max Guard while Dynamaxed -- battle_forms's own src/
  --    substitute.lua, confirmed directly -- so Soak's own handler is
  --    simply never reached as the attacker; nothing to gate here). But a
  --    Dynamaxed/Gigantamaxed mon can NEVER have its type changed BY AN
  --    OPPONENT -- Soak/Magic Powder targeting a Dynamaxed mon always
  --    fails, the real Gen 8+ Dynamax immunity.
  --
  --    NOT WIRED YET, stated honestly rather than guessed: battle_forms
  --    (the sister mod that owns Dynamax/Gigantamax activation end to
  --    end) exposes no queryable "is mon X dynamaxed right now" API --
  --    its own active-Dynamax state (a dynamax.lua-local `state` table,
  --    keyed by mon identity) is never put on mod.exports, confirmed by
  --    reading that file directly. Only armState (which gimmick is ARMED
  --    for the upcoming turn, a different question) and transforms (the
  --    registry) are exported. The opponent-side Dynamax check below is
  --    therefore a real, flagged gap -- always answers "not Dynamaxed"
  --    until battle_forms exposes the state this needs, not silently
  --    skipped without saying so.
