-- Phase 2 (part 2) of the move-effect completion pipeline: moves_new.lua's
-- recoil/drain/heal stubs (8 moves) and its two-turn/charge/recharge stubs
-- (3 moves: Bounce, Outrage, Eternabeam). Grouped in one file, not two --
-- both buckets ride the SAME real primitive shape (a `full`-kind
-- move_effects record's `afterDamage` stage callback, EffectRegistry.lua's
-- staged damaging pipeline), unlike modern_movepool_status.lua's
-- kind="secondary"+run pattern. Must load after modern_combat.lua (only
-- HEALPULSE/LIFEDEW/SYNTHESIS/PAINSPLIT below need its exports; the
-- recoil/drain/charge handlers don't, but one load order keeps every
-- Phase 2 sibling consistent).
--
-- Why `afterDamage`, not `run`, for recoil/drain/Bounce/Outrage/
-- Eternabeam: `afterDamage` is ONLY ever read by Gen 1's own damaging
-- pipeline (EffectRegistry.runDamaging, "post-damage effect bookkeeping"
-- -- confirmed, EffectRegistry.lua:307-317) and Gen 1's charge gate
-- (BattleState:performMove reads `record.charge`, :3602). Gen 2's own
-- dispatch (gen2/Battle.lua:1533-1538) never looks at either field --
-- it only ever checks `record.run`, and calling handler(...) there
-- returns immediately regardless of what the handler does inside (see
-- modern_movepool_status.lua's header for the full grounding). So a
-- record with NO `run` field is invisible to that early-return branch:
-- Gen 2 falls through to its OWN native damage path unmodified, meaning
-- these moves deal ordinary, un-recoiled/un-charged damage on Gen 2 today
-- -- not broken, just not (yet) wired there, the same "pre-existing gap,
-- not a regression" bar Phase 1 already established. Giving one of these
-- records a `run` field too (to also drive some Gen 2 behavior) would
-- flip that from "unwired" to "deals zero damage on Gen 2", strictly
-- worse -- deliberately not attempted here.
--
-- schema note: R.move_effects (src/mods/Schemas.lua:1280-1288) only lists
-- kind/accuracyChecked/run as known fields, but Schemas.check's own
-- record-mode validator explicitly allows and preserves unknown top-level
-- keys ("Unknown top-level fields are allowed and preserved -- extensible
-- records are a feature", Schemas.lua:211-217; confirmed in the actual
-- non-patch branch at :249-260, which only rejects unrecognized keys in
-- patch mode). That's what makes `afterDamage`/`charge` on a MOD-registered
-- record legal at all -- they ride through as ordinary extra fields, the
-- same way MoveEffects.full's own native records carry them.
--
-- mon.hp / mon.stats.hp are the confirmed real current/max HP fields
-- (native HEAL_EFFECT, MoveEffects.lua:201-214, reads/writes exactly
-- these two).

  -- Electro Shot: real 2-turn charge move, raises the user's own

  -- BattleState:performMove wrap for the rain-skip (same technique,
  -- same file that already documents why no sanctioned hook exists for
