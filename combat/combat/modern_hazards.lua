-- Part B Phase 5: entry hazards -- Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes,
-- Sharp Steel, Sticky Web, Rapid Spin. First of the ~49 confirmed-remaining
-- moves_new.lua stubs (see this session's own re-audit: PROTECT/DETECT
-- and the pure multiHit moves were false positives already handled
-- elsewhere, bringing the real count from the original ~68 estimate
-- down to 49).
--
-- Two different ownership models coexist here, chosen per the project's
-- golden rule (Gen 9 always wins a generational collision; non-
-- colliding native behavior is additive, never silently replaced):
--   Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, Sharp Steel: genuine Gen 4+/8+ additions
--   neither generation ever had natively, so they get their own new
--   per-side state here (battle.hazards), the same "own it outright"
--   pattern modern_weather.lua established for field state.
--   Spikes: Gen 2 has REAL native Spikes (src/battle/gen2/Battle.lua:
--   2041-2047 EFFECT_SPIKES, :3599-3613 Battle:spikesDamage) -- a
--   genuine Gen 2 cart move, not a gap. But native Spikes is Gen 2's
--   ORIGINAL, single-layer/flat-1/8 behavior; Gen 9 Spikes stacks up to
--   3 layers at 1/8 -> 1/6 -> 1/4. That is a real generational
--   collision (this engine's Gen 2-native rule vs. the current Gen 9
--   rule), so per the golden rule the native functions are monkeypatched
--   in place further down -- overridden to match Gen 9, not shadowed by
--   a second, competing hazard system the way Stealth Rock/Toxic
--   Spikes/Sharp Steel are.
--   Gen 1 has no hazard concept at all, same "own it outright" case as
--   Gen 1 weather.
--
-- Primitives, all confirmed by direct source read:
--   Switch-in hook: battle.battler_switched, confirmed IDENTICAL payload
--   shape on both generations (src/battle/BattleState.lua:2456-2459 Gen
--   1, src/battle/gen2/Battle.lua:3405-3407 Gen 2 -- that Gen 2 site's
--   own comment: "the payload BattleState:resolveSwitch emits on Gen 1").
--   battle:sideOf(who) also confirmed on both (src/battle/
--   EffectRegistry.lua:77 ctx.side wraps it for Gen 1; gen2/Battle.lua's
--   own spikesDamage calls self:sideOf(mon) directly) -- one cross-gen
--   side key ("player"/"enemy"), not two separate lookups.
--   curTypesOf/isGen2Battle: exported by modern_combat.lua, already the
--   established cross-gen live-type accessor (Transform/Conversion-
--   aware) used by modern_weather.lua's own Sand immunity check.
--   Stealth Rock / Sharp Steel damage: TypeChart.effectiveness(<type>,
--   types), a x10-scaled multiplier (confirmed src/battle/TypeChart.lua
--   :57-69) -- divided back to a real fraction for the Showdown formula
--   maxHP * effectiveness / 8. Confirmed identical shape for Sharp Steel
--   directly against Showdown's own data/moves.ts gmaxsteelsurge
--   condition (this session): "const steelHazard = ...Stealth Rock...
--   steelHazard.type = 'Steel'; ... this.damage(pokemon.maxhp *
--   (2**typeMod) / 8)" -- literally Stealth Rock's own formula re-typed
--   to Steel, which is exactly this file's own TypeChart.effectiveness
--   ("STEEL", types)/10 * maxHp/8 below.
--   Poison infliction: Gen 1's real StatusRegistry.inflict (src/battle/
--   StatusRegistry.lua:21-56, same primitive MoveEffects.lua's own
--   POISON_EFFECT/TOXIC-family moves use) and Gen 2's real
--   Battle:applyStatus (gen2/Battle.lua:2895-2926, same primitive every
--   native Gen 2 status move uses).
--   Native Spikes override: Battle.MOVE_EFFECTS.EFFECT_SPIKES and
--   Battle:spikesDamage are plain fields/methods on the Gen 2 Battle
--   CLASS table (require("src.battle.gen2.Battle")), not per-instance --
--   reassigning them after the fact affects every past and future
--   instance identically, the same monkeypatch shape
--   combat/modern_combat_protect.lua's own Part D already established
--   for BattleState.performMove.
--
-- INTERACTION TODO: Toxic Spikes' real immunity is Poison (absorbs,
-- removes the hazard), Flying-type OR Levitate (unaffected, hazard
-- stays), Steel-type (unaffected in current Showdown). Only the TYPE
-- half (Poison/Flying/Steel) is checked here -- Levitate is an ABILITY
-- exemption, and this codebase has no battle-effective abilities
-- anywhere yet (confirmed this session while building PROGRESS.md:
-- ModernStats only ASSIGNS abilities as identity data, nothing in
-- combat/ gives one an effect) -- so a Levitate mon currently gets
-- poisoned by Toxic Spikes same as any other grounded non-immune type.
-- Depends on: a real battle-effective abilities system existing at all.
-- Revisit this exact spot (the isFlyingOrSteel check below) once it does.
--
-- INTERACTION TODO: Sharp Steel is defined below (state + switch-in
-- damage) but nothing sets h.sharpSteel = true yet. Its only real cause,
-- G-Max Steelsurge, already exists as move data (Copperajah's signature,
-- gigantamax/gmax_moves.lua:59, functionCode =
-- "DamageTargetAddSteelsurgeToFoeSide") but its effect is still
-- NO_ADDITIONAL_EFFECT -- wiring it is a Gigantamax-system task (needs
-- the G-max-active/Copperajah-using-its-signature gating that lives in
-- gigantamax/, not this file), not this hazards batch. Depends on: that
-- gating existing to check against. Revisit by registering a
-- GALAR_GMAXSTEELSURGE_EFFECT (same kind="primary" shape as
-- GALAR_STEALTHROCK_EFFECT below, just h.sharpSteel and STEEL-flavored
-- text) once that gate is available.
