-- Gym Badge Buff -- explicit user request (2026-08-28): a real, honestly-
-- flagged gap turned into a togglable fix rather than silently applied.
--
-- Native Gen 2 badge boosts (Battle:battleStat's own BadgeStatBoosts
-- port, Battle:badgeTypeBoost's own DoBadgeTypeBoosts port,
-- src/battle/gen2/Battle.lua:776-808) both gate on literal object
-- identity: `mon ~= self.player then return value end` / `attacker ~=
-- self.player`. Correct in the native single-battler case (self.player
-- IS the only player-side mon that ever exists) -- silently wrong the
-- moment a real doubles/triples fight (g9-Battle-Scene's own real
-- rosters) puts a SECOND or THIRD player-side battler in play: that mon
-- is never literally self.player, so it silently computes its stats as
-- if the player owned no badges at all, even though a real Gold/Silver
-- player's badges are meant to boost their WHOLE team.
--
-- ON (default): fixed for real -- both checks become `battle:sideOf(mon)
-- == "player"` (combat/move_targeting.lua's own N-way override), so
-- every player-side battler gets the same badge boost the lead already
-- did natively. Everything else about either function (the GLACIER
-- special case, the Battle Tower guard, the badge-to-stat/type tables
-- themselves) is untouched -- only the WHO check changes.
-- OFF: badge boosts never apply to anyone, on purpose -- a genuine
-- opt-out for players who don't want this mechanic factored in at all,
-- not a "keep the narrow native behavior" middle state.
