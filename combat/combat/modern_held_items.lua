-- Held-item COMBAT effects, Phase 1: auditing the items Gen 2 already
-- has real, ROM-driven behavior for (Quick Claw, Focus Band, King's
-- Rock, BrightPowder, the Charcoal-family type-boost items, Scope Lens,
-- Leftovers) against real Pokemon Showdown Gen 9 logic, and overriding
-- every real divergence found. Explicit standing rule (2026-08-28,
-- confirmed directive): "we override item behavior for native items,
-- always, imperative, in terms of combat" -- this mod OWNS combat item
-- behavior outright, the same principle combat/legacy_move_takeover.lua
-- already established for the nine classic damage moves ("it's
-- imperative all damage goes through us, else we lose turn order
-- control"). Gen 1 has no items at all (confirmed, combat/modern_items
-- .lua's own header) -- every item in this file is structurally
-- Gen-2-only, matching that same established boundary.
--
-- Real mechanism: `held_item.trigger` (gen2/Battle.lua's own real,
-- already-mod-hookable choke point EVERY native held-item effect goes
-- through -- Quick Claw's priority roll, Scope Lens/type-boost's damage
-- check, Focus Band's endure check, King's Rock's flinch roll,
-- BrightPowder's accuracy check, Leftovers/Berry's residual tick, all
-- funnel through this ONE function, `Battle:heldEffect`). Its own real
-- contract (that function's own header comment): a wrap returning
-- (effect, parameter) SUBSTITUTES the item's real behavior at that
-- trigger; returning a non-string effect reads as "no effect," the
-- clean way to fully suppress a native mechanic this file replaces with
-- a differently-shaped one instead (BrightPowder, Scope Lens below).
--
-- Real values verified against Showdown's own actual source
-- (data/items.ts, smogon/pokemon-showdown master branch, fetched and
-- read this same pass -- the same direct-read discipline this session's
-- Leech Seed/Magic Guard/legacy-move work already established, not
-- assumed from memory) rather than guessed:
--   QUICK_CLAW  -- real Gen 9: 1/8 chance (12.5%), NOT a flat priority-
--     tie win -- modern Quick Claw is `onFractionalPriority`, adding a
--     +0.1 fractional priority BEFORE the whole-number priority/speed
--     compare. In a 2-battler engine with no other fractional-priority
--     source, this reduces to the exact same real-world OUTCOME as
--     Gen 2's own native "consulted only once priority ties" shape
--     (0.1 can win a tie against an equal whole-number priority, but
--     can never overcome a real +1 priority-point move) -- so only the
--     PROBABILITY needed correcting, not the trigger site itself. Gen
--     2's own native byte was 60/256 (~23.4%); real modern is 1/8 =
--     32/256 exactly.
--   FOCUS_BAND  -- real Gen 9: 1/10 (10%), applies only to Move-sourced
--     lethal damage (`effect.effectType === 'Move'`) -- Gen 2's own
--     native check already only fires from inside `hitOnce`'s own
--     "endure" trigger, which only ever runs for a move hit, so no
--     extra gate needed there. Native byte was 30/256 (~11.7%); real
--     modern is 1/10, nearest achievable on this same 0-256 roll scale
--     is 26/256 (~10.16%, the closest integer byte to true 10%).
--   KINGS_ROCK  -- real Gen 9: 10% (was 30/256, ~11.7%, on the native
--     byte scale -- same rounding as Focus Band, 26/256). Real modern
--     rule ALSO only ADDS the flinch chance to a move's own secondary
--     list if that move doesn't already carry a flinch secondary of its
--     own (`if (secondary.volatileStatus === 'flinch') return`) -- so a
--     King's Rock holder using Rock Slide/Headbutt/Bite/Iron Head (the
--     EFFECT_FLINCH_HIT family) should NOT also get King's Rock's own
--     separate roll on top. Gen 2's own native check (BattleCommand_
--     HeldFlinch) has no such exemption -- confirmed by direct read, a
--     real, genuine double-dip bug fixed here by checking the currently
--     resolving move's own effect (via `battle:volatile(attacker)
--     .lastMove`, written by `Battle:useMove` before `hitOnce` ever
--     runs -- the same real field Disable/Encore/Mirror Move already
--     rely on, reused rather than building new state) against
--     EFFECT_FLINCH_HIT before honoring the item at all.
--   BRIGHTPOWDER -- real Gen 9: a genuine MULTIPLICATIVE ~90% accuracy
--     factor (`chainModify([3686, 4096])`), not an additive penalty.
--     Gen 2's own native check (`Battle:moveAccuracy`) subtracts a flat
--     byte (20, scaled to the percent domain) from the accuracy number
--     BEFORE the roll -- a genuinely different SHAPE, not just a
--     different number (a flat -7.8-ish points is a much smaller nerf
--     against a high-accuracy move and a much bigger one against a
--     low-accuracy move than a real 10% multiplicative cut). Since the
--     two shapes can't be reconciled by adjusting the native byte
--     parameter alone, this file suppresses the native check entirely
--     (returns a non-string effect at the "accuracy" trigger) and
--     re-implements it as a real `registerAccuracyModifier` entry
--     instead (the same real, already-sanctioned multiplier chain
--     abilities/engine/accuracy_multiplier.lua's own Compound Eyes/
--     Hustle/Victory Star already use) -- the correct shape, not an
--     approximation forced into the wrong mechanism.
--   Type-boost items (CHARCOAL, MYSTIC_WATER, MIRACLE_SEED, MAGNET,
--     NEVERMELTICE, BLACKBELT_I, POISON_BARB, SOFT_SAND, SHARP_BEAK,
--     TWISTEDSPOON, BLACKGLASSES, HARD_STONE, METAL_COAT, DRAGON_FANG,
--     SILVERPOWDER) -- real Gen 9: +20% (`chainModify([4915, 4096])`,
--     confirmed via Charcoal's own real source entry), a real
--     GENERATIONAL buff over Gen 2's own native +10%. **STALE AS
--     ORIGINALLY WRITTEN HERE**: the fix below (overriding the native
--     "damage" trigger's own parameter) was confirmed DEAD CODE the very
--     next pass (combat/modern_held_items_phase2.lua's own header) --
--     computeModernDamage never reads the native itemBoostPercent field
--     at all. Real, reachable fix now lives in that file's own
--     "held_item_type_boost" registerDamageModifier entry instead; this
--     file's own "damage" trigger no longer touches these items.
--   SCOPE_LENS -- real Gen 9: +1 crit stage, the same real family Focus
--     Energy's own +2 stages already belongs to. Gen 2's own native
--     HELD_CRITICAL_UP check feeds Gen 2's own OWN crit LADDER (a
--     completely different system -- speed-based odds, no discrete
--     stages at all) -- but that native roll is CONFIRMED DEAD CODE
--     under this mod already: combat/modern_combat.lua's own
--     computeModernDamage (the real handler this mod installs on
--     "battle.damage") independently re-rolls its own crit via a SECOND
--     "battle.crit" call using its own real Gen 6+ stage system
--     (modernCritStage/modernCritRoll, confirmed by direct read: it
--     never consults ctx.opts.critical, the field Gen 2's own native
--     pre-roll would have populated), so whatever the native ladder
--     decided is silently discarded whenever this mod's own damage path
--     runs -- meaning Scope Lens currently does NOTHING under this mod,
--     a real, confirmed bug of the exact same shape ("registered
--     somewhere real code never reaches") this same day's earlier
--     Wonder-Guard-reachability review already found twice. Fixed by
--     registering a real `registerCritStageModifier` entry instead --
--     the correct, already-live system, not the dead native one.
--   LEFTOVERS -- checked, NOT changed: real Gen 9 is `baseMaxhp / 16`
--     per turn, identical to Gen 2's own native `HELD_LEFTOVERS` heal
--     amount (`gen2/Battle.lua:4901`, confirmed by direct read) -- the
--     one item in this batch that was already correct.
