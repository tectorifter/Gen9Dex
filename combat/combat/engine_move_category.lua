-- Physical/Special/Status resolution for a move record, for display
-- (SummaryMenu page 2, anywhere else a moveset with PP is shown) -- not
-- used by the native damage calc, which already has its own answer for
-- this (Damage.isSpecial / TypeChart.category, unchanged, untouched here).
--
-- Native Gen 1 moves (the engine's own generated moves.lua, machine-
-- generated from the ROM) have no category field at all: Gen 1 determines Physical/Special
-- purely from the move's TYPE, via the same data-driven lookup the native
-- damage calc already uses (TypeChart.category, src/battle/TypeChart.lua)
-- -- reused here rather than reimplemented. Status moves are power = 0 in
-- this data (confirmed directly, e.g. GROWL), checked before the type
-- lookup so a status move's type doesn't misreport it as Physical/Special.
--
-- Showdown-originated moves (anything not among the original 165, reached
-- through a Showdown-backed battle) carry their own real category field
-- from Showdown's movedex -- that field is populated onto the move record
-- by the Phase 4 data-mapping work (ShowdownTeam.lua and whatever loads
-- Showdown move data for Lua), read directly here rather than guessed at
-- from type, since Gen 4+ broke the strict type-implies-category rule
-- (e.g. Focus Blast/Special vs Close Combat/Physical, both Fighting).
--
-- Lives in GalarGmaxDex's own folder, not the engine tree -- loaded once
-- by main.lua into mod.exports.MoveCategory (see engine_modern_stats.lua's
-- own header for the full reasoning, including why this moved off
-- package.preload).
