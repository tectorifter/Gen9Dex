-- Phase 3 (part 2) of the move-effect completion pipeline: Metal Burst and
-- Mirror Coat, the two Counter-family stubs (moves_new.lua's METALBURST/
-- MIRRORCOAT, both still effect="NO_ADDITIONAL_EFFECT" going into this
-- file). DETECT's patch lives directly in modern_combat_protect.lua (the
-- identical one-line pattern to that file's own PROTECT patch); FEINT's
-- Protect-bypass is a plain moves_new.lua data field (bypassesProtect),
-- patched onto the live FEINT record by main.lua's wireMovepoolSubEffects
-- -- neither needs a move_effects registration of its own, so neither
-- lives here.
--
-- What COUNTER's real implementation turned out to be (grepped src/battle/
-- MoveEffects.lua and EffectRegistry.lua for "COUNTER" first, per this
-- phase's own instruction, before writing anything): NOT a move_effects
-- record at all -- a hardcoded `if move.id == "COUNTER"` branch inside
-- EffectRegistry.lua's runDamaging (:149-171), reading `battle.lastDamage`,
-- Gen 1's shared wDamage byte -- the LAST damage dealt ANYWHERE in the
-- battle (by either side, from any source), gated only by whether the
-- opponent's last move was itself counterable (Normal/Fighting type,
-- power > 0). No physical/special split exists anywhere in it, and it
-- doesn't reset per turn -- both real, well-known Gen 1 Counter quirks (its
-- own "can counter your OWN last hit" exploitability), not a primitive
-- Metal Burst/Mirror Coat -- which need a genuine "physical or special
-- damage taken THIS turn" split -- can reuse.
--
-- Gen 2 DOES have the real primitive for exactly that split, but it's
-- Gen2-only and unreachable from a mod-registered move_effects record:
-- `defenderState.tookThisTurn`/`tookKind` (gen2/Battle.lua:1201-1202,
-- accumulated per hit inside Battle:dealDamage, cleared at the top of
-- every turn, gen2/Battle.lua:4028-4029) feeds a hardcoded `Effects.COUNTER`
-- table (gen2/Battle.lua:1478, gen2/Effects.lua:219-226) mapping
-- `def.effect == "EFFECT_COUNTER"`/`"EFFECT_MIRROR_COAT"` straight to
-- native dispatch (gen2/Battle.lua:1476-1489) -- entirely bypassing
-- mod.content.move_effects (Gen2's own dispatch, gen2/Battle.lua:1533-1538,
-- only ever reads a record's `.run` field -- the same limitation
-- modern_movepool_damage.lua's own header already established for
-- afterDamage/charge). Confirmed by grepping this engine's own shipped
-- data for the literal ids: no "COUNTER", "MIRRORCOAT", or "METALBURST"
-- move exists anywhere in it -- Gen 2's native Counter/Mirror Coat
-- mechanism is real, correct, tested code with nothing pointing at it yet.
--
-- Deliberately NOT rerouting MIRRORCOAT's effect field at the literal
-- native "EFFECT_MIRROR_COAT" string to pick that mechanism up for free:
-- same cross-generation reference risk modern_movepool_damage.lua's own
-- header already flags for Bounce/Outrage/Eternabeam -- move.effect is
-- validated as f.id("move_effects") against whichever generation's
-- registry is active for that boot, and Gen 1's own registry has no
-- "EFFECT_MIRROR_COAT" id, so a Gen 1 boot's registration would fail
-- outright. A custom GALAR_* id, registered fresh on every boot like every
-- other Phase 1/2 sibling, is the only shape valid on both.
--
-- Known, stated Gen 2 gap (not silently left unmentioned): METALBURST and
-- MIRRORCOAT below are GEN1-ONLY, the same "unwired, not broken" class of
-- gap as Bounce/Outrage/Eternabeam. On a Gen 2 boot these fall through to
-- Gen 2's own native damage path -- but since neither id exists in Gen 2's
-- own native data, that's an ordinary (and near-useless, given the power=1
-- placeholder) hit, not real Metal Burst/Mirror Coat. Gen 2 already has a
-- fully-correct native Mirror Coat sitting unused for exactly the reason
-- above; wiring MIRRORCOAT's Gen2-side data at the real "EFFECT_MIRROR_COAT"
-- id (a second, Gen2-specific registration path, not this file's custom
-- one) and building the Gen4-only Metal Burst into Gen 2's own dispatch/
-- priority table from scratch are both real follow-on work, not attempted
-- here.
--
-- The turn-scoped "damage taken by category" tracker: Gen 1 has no
-- existing primitive for this at all (unlike Protect's own turn-scoped
-- flag, which had a real value worth reusing -- Counter's shared
-- battle.lastDamage, per above, genuinely isn't one). Built here, but out
-- of two REAL existing primitives, not a new hook: `battle.damage_dealt`
-- (already emitted per landed hit by EffectRegistry.lua:285-290 --
-- confirmed zero consumers anywhere in this mod before this file) to
-- observe and accumulate, and the exact same `battle.turn_started` event
-- modern_combat_protect.lua's own Part C already uses to clear per-turn
-- state, in the same way, for the same reason.
--
-- chooseDamage, not perform: EffectRegistry.lua's runDamaging already has
-- a dedicated extension point for exactly this move family --
-- record.chooseDamage, explicitly commented there as "Counter/Super
-- Fang/OHKO/fixed damage" (:172-181) -- and it runs AFTER the normal
-- invulnerability check and accuracy roll (both earlier in runDamaging,
-- ~:104-145), unlike record.perform, which BattleState:performMove
-- dispatches to (:3631-3634) BEFORE either. A perform-shaped handler
-- modeled too literally on Protect's own (a genuinely different case: a
-- power=0, priority-4 status move that never rolls a miss in any real
-- generation) would have silently skipped Metal Burst/Mirror Coat's real
-- accuracy check (evasion, a mid-Fly/Dig target) entirely -- a real
-- behavioral gap, not a style choice, which is why this deviates from a
-- literal perform-shaped read of the plan. A failed chooseDamage returns
-- (nil, message) -- runDamaging's own caller prints it and cancels the
-- move anim on its own (:176-179), so unlike Protect's perform, this needs
-- no ctx.say call itself.
--
-- ROUND 16 (all moves through the mod's battle.damage deliver chain):
-- the counter family was the one real, remaining bypass. Gen 1's
-- chooseDamage returned its number straight to runDamaging (applied
-- directly, never through Runtime.call("battle.damage", ...)); Gen 2's
-- run called battle:dealDamage directly. Both are now thin fail-detection
-- + routing shims: every SUCCESSFUL counter/mirror/metal-burst routes its
-- number through routeThroughBattleDamage (the shared helper this mod
-- exports from combat/legacy_move_takeover.lua), so Protect, Sturdy,
-- every type-immunity ability, Wonder Guard and the mod's damage pipeline
-- all see it exactly like a normal hit -- and the actual number is
-- re-derived authoritatively by legacy_move_takeover.lua's battle.damage
-- priority-1 wrap (keyed on the move id, reading this file's exported
-- counterFamilyParams), which is what keeps it alive past modern_combat
-- .lua's terminal formula wrap (priority 0) that would otherwise clobber
-- any precomputed base with a power=1 placeholder result. Fail-detection
-- (Protect, damage-taken-this-turn, category match, original attacker
-- still out) deliberately stays HERE in chooseDamage/run, not the wrap --
-- a failed counter must print "But, it failed!" / "doesn't affect" via the
-- native (nil, message) contract and must never reach battle.damage at all.
--
-- Protect: chooseDamage bypasses battle:computeDamage entirely (it's a
-- parallel branch inside runDamaging, not a call into it), so it also
-- bypasses modern_combat_protect.lua's own battle.damage hook (that file's
-- Part B) -- re-checked manually here, reusing the exact same "It doesn't
-- affect %s!" message that hook's own typeMult=0 short-circuit produces
-- (EffectRegistry.lua:187-191), so a protected target sees identical
-- failure text regardless of which code path blocked the hit. Neither move
-- sets bypassesProtect (that's Feint-only), but the check mirrors Part B's
-- exact condition shape anyway rather than a narrower one.
--
-- "Original attacker already fainted or switched out" (both moves' real
-- fail condition, per Showdown): stored alongside the accumulated damage
-- is the attacker's own MON table, not the battler slot -- battle.player/
-- battle.enemy are stable per-side tables reused across a switch (only
-- their own `.mon` field changes, confirmed by Pain Split's own
-- userMon/targetMon reads in modern_movepool_damage.lua), so comparing
-- battler identity alone could never detect a mid-battle switch. Requires
-- ctx.target.mon to still be that exact same mon table, with hp > 0.
-- ROUND 21b (last-hit + consume + retarget + Metal Burst priority). Three
-- reported behaviors, all in the user's message:
--  * "still preserving FIRST damage taken" -- the accumulator was a running
--    TOTAL (each hit added), so a second hit made the counter answer the
--    whole turn's combined damage instead of the last hit. Now each hit
--    REPLACES the stored amount (last-hit wins), matching Showdown's
--    counter family (and the user's multi-battler rule: "only accounts for
--    the last damage taken, not the whole damage taken").
--  * "returning it on every move use without getting clean after the move
--    is used" -- the stored hit was never consumed by using the counter, so
--    a Metal Burst used with no fresh damage kept re-answering stale
--    damage every turn. Now both the Gen 1 chooseDamage and the Gen 2 run
--    clear the stored hit on every use -- success OR fail -- so a counter
--    answers exactly one hit, exactly once.
--  * multi-battler retaliation -- Gen 2's native Effects.COUNTER table
--    deals to the player's SELECTED target, not the last attacker. The
--    run now stores the attacker battler (battle.damage_dealt's `user`,
--    which IS the attacker) alongside the damage and deals the counter to
--    THAT battler, failing if it is no longer out -- the user's rule for
--    every counter-like move.
--  * Metal Burst priority -- the real counter family moves at priority -5;
--    national_dex's own METALBURST record says priority=0 (Counter and
--    Mirror Coat already carry -5), and turn_order.lua's movePriority reads
--    a record's own priority field first (explicit 0 included), so without
--    a patch Metal Burst shared the normal band and moved BEFORE the hit it
--    was answering whenever the user was faster -- the "Turn 0" sequence
--    (hit lands, then Metal Burst answers) could not happen. Patched onto
--    the live record below.
-- ROUND 21c (native-volatile leak, the follow-up report "something's still
-- loading damage to metal burst and it's not clearing it -- when spammed it
-- still kills pokemon despite no damage being dealt"). The 21b run still had
-- a native-volatile FALLBACK (battle:volatile(user).tookThisTurn) for "a hit
-- the mod's listener never observed". The engine clears that volatile ONLY
-- for battle.player/battle.enemy at turn start (gen2/Battle.lua), so in
-- g9-Battle-Scene's real doubles/triples/boss/horde rosters a NON-lead
-- battler's tookThisTurn was never cleared: stale damage sat in it forever,
-- the fallback re-read it every Metal Burst/Counter/Mirror Coat use, and the
-- counter kept answering turns-old damage even when nothing hit the user this
-- turn -- "spammed, still kills". The fallback is now REMOVED from both the
-- Gen 2 run (this file) and the shared battle.damage wrap
-- (legacy_move_takeover.lua): the mod's own accumulator is the single source
-- of truth, the engine emits battle.damage_dealt for every landed hit so a
-- real hit is always observed, and nil genuinely means "nothing hit us this
-- turn" -> fail.
