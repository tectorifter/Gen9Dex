-- Phase 4 of the move-effect completion pipeline: weather. Wires
-- moves_new.lua's RAINDANCE/SUNNYDAY/SANDSTORM/SNOWSCAPE (weather
-- starters), BLIZZARD (Snow accuracy exception) and SOLARBEAM (Sun
-- charge-skip) to real, Showdown-checked behavior, on top of the
-- weather STATE (battle.weather/battle.weatherTurns, currentWeather/
-- setWeather/WEATHER_TURNS) and the Sun/Rain Fire/Water damage
-- modifier that combat/modern_combat.lua itself now owns (see that
-- file's own "Phase 4" header block -- state and the flat damage
-- multiplier live there because computeModernDamage needs them inline
-- for Snow's Ice-type Defense boost anyway). This file owns the
-- WIRING: the four starter moves, Thunder/Blizzard's accuracy
-- exception, Solar Beam's charge-skip, and Sand's end-of-turn chip.
-- Must load after modern_combat.lua (consumes its exports).
--
-- Explicitly OUT of scope, per this session's own instruction, not
-- silently added:
--   Hail / the classic "Hail" move and weather value -- "we won't bring
--     hail yet." Snow (Snowscape) is Gen 9's real replacement and is
--     the only Ice-flavored weather this file builds.
--   Sand's old Rock-type Sp. Def boost (real in Gen 4-8, explicitly
--     called out as out of scope in the plan itself).
--   Synthesis's weather-conditional heal fraction -- modern_movepool_
--     damage.lua's own header already flagged this as Phase 4's job to
--     come back for; still not touched here (not in this session's
--     explicit "what to build" list) -- Synthesis stays the flat 1/2
--     it shipped with in Phase 2.
--   Blizzard's real 10% freeze secondary -- a genuine Showdown
--     mechanic, but not requested this pass (only the accuracy
--     exception was) -- GALAR_BLIZZARD_EFFECT below is deliberately
--     empty, not a partial implementation pretending to be whole.
--
-- Gen 2 native weather, confirmed by direct read of gen2/Battle.lua/
-- Effects.lua before writing anything here (not assumed):
--   Rain Dance/Sunny Day/Sandstorm already exist as native Gen 2 moves
--   whose effect field is the literal "EFFECT_RAIN_DANCE"/"EFFECT_
--   SUNNY_DAY"/"EFFECT_SANDSTORM" string, dispatched through Battle.
--   MOVE_EFFECT_RECORDS (built from Battle.MOVE_EFFECTS, gen2/Battle.lua
--   :1896-1906) -- these ALREADY set self.weather/self.weatherTurns
--   correctly and ALREADY apply real (if Gen-2-cart-accurate, not
--   Gen9-current) Fire/Water damage multipliers and sandstorm chip via
--   Effects.lua, entirely independent of any move_effects registration.
--   BUT per this session's "Confirmed current state": these three ids
--   are registered by national_dex today (unconditionally, ~833 modern
--   moves, real power/accuracy/type, placeholder effect), which SHADOWS
--   whatever native registration existed underneath -- so today, before
--   this file, RAINDANCE/SUNNYDAY/SANDSTORM's live `effect` field is
--   national_dex's stub, NOT "EFFECT_RAIN_DANCE" et al, and Gen 2's own
--   native weather dispatch for these three is ALREADY unreachable
--   (shadowed), not something this file newly breaks. Overriding them
--   with real GALAR_* effect ids (below) doesn't sever an already-
--   working native path; it fills a gap that was already there. Same
--   reasoning modern_movepool_damage.lua's own header already applies
--   to Bounce/Outrage/Eternabeam.
--
--   Once overridden, GalarGmaxDex's own handlers below are the ONLY
--   thing setting battle.weather/battle.weatherTurns on Gen 2 -- but
--   they write into the exact same two REAL native fields, using Gen
--   2's own lowercase value convention, so every other native consumer
--   already keyed off self.weather (Effects.weatherHealFraction,
--   gen2/Ai.lua's sun check, the EFFECT_SOLARBEAM sun-skip at gen2/
--   Battle.lua:1460) keeps working automatically for rain/sun/sandstorm
--   -- see modern_combat.lua's own "Phase 4" header for the full
--   grounding. Gen 2's own Fire/Water weatherPercent computation
--   (gen2/Battle.lua:1091-1098) is DEAD regardless of any of this,
--   though: modern_combat.lua's battle.damage hook fully replaces
--   Gen 2's native damage calc too (confirmed, gen2/Battle.lua:1108-
--   1119 routes through the exact same hook BattleState:computeDamage
--   uses on Gen 1, and modern_combat.lua's own header says its hook
--   "never calls next()") -- which is exactly why this project needs
--   its OWN "weather" registerDamageModifier entry (modern_combat.lua)
--   at all, on both generations.
--
-- Gen 2 gap, honestly flagged, not silently assumed away: Solar Beam's
-- Sun charge-skip is native-hardcoded on Gen 2 (`Effects.CHARGE[def.
-- effect]` and the literal `def.effect == "EFFECT_SOLARBEAM"` check,
-- gen2/Battle.lua:1455-1462) -- checked BEFORE Gen 2's generic move_
-- effects merge even runs, keyed purely off the literal native effect
-- string. Overriding SOLARBEAM's effect field to GALAR_SOLARBEAM_EFFECT
-- (required so Gen 1 gets a real charge at all -- national_dex's stub
-- has none) makes that native check stop matching, so Gen 2 Solar Beam
-- falls through to an ordinary, un-charged, un-skipped hit -- same as
-- today (per the "already shadowed by national_dex" note above, this
-- native path is not reachable today either), so no regression, but
-- also no fix: Gen 2 Solar Beam remains uncharged after this file, the
-- same class of gap Bounce/Outrage/Eternabeam already carry.
