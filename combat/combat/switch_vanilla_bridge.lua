-- Bridges combat/switch_primitives.lua's player-side switch request into
-- vanilla's own battle scene. A self-switch effect sets battle.forcedSwitch
-- = true and emits {kind="switch-request", side=, mon=, text=} -- native
-- runTurn (gen1recomp-dev's own gen2/Battle.lua, completely unmodified)
-- already knows how to end a round on forcedSwitch, exactly the way a real
-- faint or a Roar/Whirlwind drag-out already do, so by the time this event
-- reaches BattleState:advanceQueue the round is already fully over -- there
-- is nothing to "resume". This file's only job is opening a real party pick
-- and, once the player chooses, performing a plain Battle:switch(index) --
-- native, unmodified, the exact same call BattleState:openParty's own
-- forced branch already makes for a faint.
--
-- Deliberately its own small party-menu opener rather than a call to
-- BattleState:openParty(true): openParty's own onCancel/refusal reopen
-- logic (the "refuse-switch" phase) is hardcoded to call openParty itself
-- again, and touching that native flow to redirect it would mean editing
-- BattleState.lua -- this mod stays self-contained by never doing that,
-- accepting the resulting minor UX gap this file's own header already
-- notes: an invalid pick (egg, fainted, already the active mon) reopens
-- the list at once here, with no interstitial "no will to fight"-style
-- line, instead of native's own timed message first.
