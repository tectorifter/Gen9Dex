-- Terastallization's own combat mechanics: everything battle_forms's own
-- src/tera.lua does NOT already give us for free, per explicit user scope
-- (2026-08-20) -- "any and all sub effects and effects are to be handled
-- by battle engine, we are the bible and process of combat," the same
-- ruling that put Protect/Max Guard here (combat/modern_combat_protect.lua).
--
-- WHAT BATTLE_FORMS ALREADY HANDLES, confirmed by direct read of its own
-- src/tera.lua: the menu cell, the once-per-battle registry slot, TERA
-- BLAST's type substitution, and -- the important one -- DEFENSIVE typing
-- for the 18 standard types. `battler.curTypes`/`mon.formTypes = { id }`
-- (src/tera.lua:346-354) already fully replaces every resistance/
-- weakness/immunity with the chosen type's own, for free, through the
-- exact same field this mod's own curTypesOf() already reads for type
-- effectiveness (modern_combat.lua:897-904) -- nothing to add there for a
-- standard type.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES NOT HANDLE, and this file fixes:
--
-- 1. STAB. battle_forms's curTypes override is defensive-only in its own
--    design intent, but curTypesOf() is the SAME list modern_combat.lua's
--    "stab" damage modifier reads for the ATTACKER's own types
--    (modern_combat.lua:143-148) -- so once Terastallized, "stab" silently
--    starts reading ONLY the tera type, losing the original type(s)'
--    STAB entirely. Real Gen 9 keeps both: original types keep their
--    1.5x, and if the Tera Type happens to match one of them, THAT type's
--    STAB rises to 2.0x instead (corroborated against Pokemon Showdown's
--    own mechanic, not invented here) -- e.g. a Water-type Pokemon
--    Terastallizing into Water does not "change nothing" the way
--    battle_forms's own header muses for the defensive side; Water moves
--    go from 1.5x to a real 2.0x. A brand-new Tera Type (not one of the
--    mon's own) gets the ordinary 1.5x, same as any other type match --
--    never stacked with the original types' own 1.5x, since a move only
--    ever has one type. "stab" itself is patched (see modern_combat.lua's
--    own header, which already reserved this exact seam) to defer
--    entirely -- return 1.0 -- whenever this file reports the attacker
--    Terastallized, so this file's own "tera_stab" (priority 110, above
--    "stab"'s 100) is the only STAB source active during Tera and there is
--    no double-counting.
--
-- 2. Stellar's own unique rules, corroborated against Bulbapedia's and
--    Pokemon Showdown's documented Gen 9 behavior:
--    a. Defensively, Stellar is the one Tera Type that does NOT replace
--       typing -- a Stellar-Terastallized Pokemon keeps its ORIGINAL
--       types' resistances/weaknesses/immunities in full, and is
--       ADDITIONALLY always weak to Stellar-type moves specifically, on
--       top of whatever its real types already are or aren't weak to.
--       battle_forms structurally cannot represent this (its own
--       mechanism is "replace with one type," full stop) -- and, per
--       explicit user answer this session, Stellar is not reachable
--       through battle_forms's own menu at all (its TERA_CHOICES list
--       never included it), so this is this mod's own domain end to end.
--    b. Offensively, a Stellar Terastallization boosts every move's own
--       type once each: 2x for the Pokemon's original type(s), 1.2x
--       (4915/4096, the real Showdown fraction, not a rounded 1.2) for
--       every other type including Stellar itself -- tracked per Pokemon
--       per Terastallization, consumed the first time each type is used.
--    c. A Pokemon hacked into Stellar typing without Terastallizing would
--       default to Poison defensively per Bulbapedia -- not implemented:
--       nothing in this engine can set a real, permanent Stellar type
--       outside of this mechanic (no Conversion/Conversion 2 exists here),
--       so the case cannot occur and there is nothing to guard against.
--
-- NOT IMPLEMENTED, both confirmed absent from this codebase entirely
-- (grepped) rather than silently stubbed: Transform/Imposter (no such
-- move/ability exists anywhere in this mod or the base engine) would need
-- to refuse against a Stellar-Terastallized Pokemon; Tera Starstorm
-- (Terapagos's own signature move, Terapagos is not a species this roster
-- includes) would need to hit both foes when Stellar. Both are dead
-- specification until either exists to attach to.
--
-- REACHABILITY, stated plainly: Stellar has no in-game trigger yet. This
-- file builds the full mechanic (defensive override, attack economy, the
-- Tera Blast variant below) against tera_state.lua's own per-mon storage,
-- but nothing here adds a menu cell or other way for a player to actually
-- pick STELLAR and have a real Terastallization happen. That is real,
-- separate, not-yet-requested work -- either battle_forms's own menu
-- cell would need to learn about a type its author never gave it a slot
-- for, or this mod needs its own trigger. The 18 standard types need none
-- of that: they Terastallize today through battle_forms's existing menu,
-- and everything in this file (STAB fix included) already applies to them.
--
-- DETECTION, redesigned (2026-08-20) around a real activation signal
-- instead of inferring one. The previous version detected Terastallization
-- by diffing curTypes/formTypes against the species' own types -- worked
-- for the 18 standard types (their whole mechanism IS that field), but
-- could never see Stellar at all (deliberately touches neither field) and
-- carried a real, if narrow, false-negative gap even for standard types
-- (a monotype mon Terastallizing into its own type is indistinguishable
-- from never having Terastallized, since the live list reads identical
-- either way).
--
-- Signal, confirmed landed in battle_forms v0.75.1 (the exact version the
-- user keeps in src/battle_forms.zip): battle_forms's own formapi emits
-- `mod.battle_forms.tera_applied` (its exported name constant
-- M.TERA_APPLIED, formapi.lua) at the exact point its src/tera.lua
-- activate() commits -- for all three branches (Stellar, Gen 2, Gen 1),
-- from its once-per-battle transformation call site (deps.api.tera(true,
-- { mon = mon, data = battle.data }) -> formapi.tera -> emit). The
-- payload (formapi's payload() helper) carries the REAL mon object --
-- confirmed for Gen 2: src/battlerof.lua's own M.mon() is a pure
-- pass-through, so this is the actual, persistent party-slot table, not
-- a name or a copy -- object identity is what makes this reliable even
-- between two Pokemon sharing a species and a name, which a name-text
-- match never could be -- plus teraType, species, form, isPlayer, and a
-- `tera` field that is truthy exactly when Terastallized. It carries NO
-- `battle` field (formapi's payload is deliberately battle-independent),
-- so this listener keys off `mon` alone. DELIBERATELY not the resolved
-- type: we keep our own per-mon Tera Type (tera_state.lua) as the one
-- source of truth for WHAT type, and only ever take WHETHER-AND-WHO from
-- battle_forms's own signal.
--
-- STATUS: live as of round 7 (2026-09-06). The event fires for every
-- real Terastallization through battle_forms's own menu, and this file's
-- STAB fix / Stellar handling / Tera Blast Stellar variant now activate
-- for real on it -- no longer the accepted-inert placeholder it was when
-- the dev had not yet landed the emit.

  -- OWNERSHIP ENFORCEMENT (round 9, 2026-09-06). Per explicit user
  -- instruction, battle_forms must never decide a Tera type -- it only
  -- reports WHEN one triggers. Two sides to that here:
  --
  -- 1. ensureBattleFormsGate (gigantamax/tera_state.lua) forces battle_forms'
  --    TERA TYPE dev option to AUTO unless bf_tera_dev is ON, so its dev
  --    choice can never override our stored types. Re-ensured on every
  --    battle.started and on the tera_applied event because battle_forms is
  --    an optional dependency that may boot before OR after us -- by the
  --    time a battle runs (or an activation event fires) it is certainly
  --    loaded, and the call is idempotent.
  --
  -- 2. ensureTeraStamps pre-stamps every mon that could Terastallize --
  --    getTeraType() -> mon.battleFormsTeraType -- at battle start and on
  --    every switch-in, so battle_forms' own DVs-derived fallback
  --    (src/teratype.lua, reached only when the stamp is absent) is
  --    unreachable: the stamp is always present and always equals OUR type.
  --    Without this, a mon nobody had ever viewed in a stats screen (no
  --    stored value yet, no stamp) would get battle_forms' DVs answer
  --    deployed, which can differ from the type this mod's own getTeraType
  --    would roll for it -- two sources of truth for one mechanic, the
  --    exact incoherence the user reported.
  --
  --    `who` here may be a Gen 1 battler WRAPPER ({ mon = mon, ... },
  --    BattleState.lua's makeBattler) or the mon itself on Gen 2 -- the
  --    wrapper's own `mon` field is the discriminator, the identical check
  --    battle_forms' own src/battlerof.lua uses (a raw Pokemon record never
  --    carries one). Resolved before stamping so the fields land on the
