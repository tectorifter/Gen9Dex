-- The one generic "this mon's own side switches out mid-move, battle keeps
-- going" primitive -- U-turn, Volt Switch, Baton Pass are the first real
-- callers, but per explicit user decision this is meant to be the SAME
-- entrypoint any future ability or item effect reaches for too, not a
-- moves-only mechanism.
--
-- HARD CONSTRAINT, explicit user correction this session: this mod must be
-- fully self-contained -- gen1recomp-dev's own engine source is NEVER
-- edited, only real, live Lua tables/methods on the shared Battle class are
-- monkeypatched from this mod's own code (the same established pattern
-- every other file here already uses -- Battle:useMove wraps, Battle.
-- moveEffectRecordFor swaps, Effects.BATON_PASS_DROPS table mutation).
-- That rules out the "pause mid-round inside a coroutine, resume the REST
-- of that same native round afterward" design this file went through
-- earlier this session: gen2/Battle.lua's own turn-resolution function
-- (runTurn) is a LOCAL, unexported closure -- not Battle.runTurn -- so no
-- mod, this one included, can reach inside it to inject a pause point.
-- Already documented before this session started, combat/
-- MULTI_BATTLE_HOOKS.md's own "What's still missing" section says exactly
-- this ("no mid-turn hook exists... not reachable from mod code as it
-- stands"). This file no longer tries to route around that.
--
-- What IS achievable, fully mod-side: the same mechanism a real faint (or
-- a Roar/Whirlwind drag-out) already uses -- the round ends AT the switch,
-- via the real, public battle.forcedSwitch field native runTurn already
-- checks (AFTER both sides' actions have run) to skip end-of-turn residual
-- and return early. Confirmed by direct read: runTurn always calls
-- enemyAttack()/playerAttack() for whichever side hasn't gone yet before
-- it ever checks forcedSwitch, so a player-side self-switch does NOT skip
-- the opponent's own action this round -- only the residual sweep (weather
-- chip, status damage, screen countdown, etc.) is skipped. That is the
-- one, real, honest gap versus current Showdown (which keeps residual
-- too), not silently passed off as exact.
