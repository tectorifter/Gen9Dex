-- The three "dimension" field effects -- Trick Room, Magic Room and Wonder
-- Room -- owned together here because they share one shape (a 5-turn
-- whole-field condition, re-using it toggles it off, a boss fight may lock
-- it permanently) and one move-ban/flag surface.
--
-- EVERY mechanic below is verified against real Pokemon Showdown source
-- (data/moves.ts's own trickroom/magicroom/wonderroom `condition` objects,
-- fetched and read locally this pass, not recalled):
--   - all three `duration: 5`; using one counts as the first of those five;
--     using it again while it is active removes it (`onFieldRestart` ->
--     `this.field.removePseudoWeather(...)`), a toggle, not a refresh.
--   - Trick Room reverses SPEED order within a priority bracket. Priority
--     itself is national_dex's to own (explicit user rule) and
--     combat/turn_order.lua's own movePriority reads it straight from
--     national_dex -- this file patches only the sub-effect that runs.
--   - Magic Room suppresses every held item's effect for the duration
--     (Showdown: `Pokemon.ignoringItem()`).
--   - Wonder Room swaps every active Pokemon's Defense and Sp. Def for the
--     duration (Showdown: "Swapping defenses partially implemented in
--     sim/pokemon.js:Pokemon#calculateStat and Pokemon#getStat").
--
-- Gen 2 has NO native concept of any of these -- all three are Generation
-- IV moves, and this engine recompiles Gold/Silver. Unlike weather
-- (combat/modern_weather.lua's own header: Gen 2's native tickWeather
-- already runs a real duration pass, so that file skips Gen 2 to avoid
-- double-ticking), there is nothing native here to defer to or collide
-- with -- the duration countdowns below are the only mechanisms that will
-- ever run them, with no Gen2-skip guard needed.
--
-- Storage: Trick Room and Magic Room are field state on the battle object
-- (battle.trickRoomActive/battle.trickRoomTurns, battle.magicRoomActive/
-- battle.magicRoomTurns), the same convention weather's own
-- battle.weather/battle.weatherTurns already uses. Wonder Room's swap is
-- per-battler, so it sets a `wonderRoomActive` flag on each ACTIVE mon
-- (re-applied to every switch-in while the room is up, cleared the moment
-- the room ends) -- that flag is what combat/modern_combat.lua's own
-- `rawStat` reads to swap the def/spd key. It is deliberately NOT in
-- combat/status_condition_cleanup.lua's switch-scoped list: a switch must
-- re-APPLY it, not clear it, so this file owns the field end to end.
--
-- Boss-fight "dimension" protections (combat/boss_fight.lua), four
-- independent flags, not one combined "dimension" flag:
--   dimensionLock -- bans all three room moves from being used at all.
--     Does NOT activate any of them itself -- a pure "no room
--     shenanigans" gate.
--   trickRoom / magicRoom / wonderRoom -- the battle is permanently in
--     that room from the moment the flag is set (battle.<room>Active /
--     <room>Turns written directly in combat/boss_fight.lua's own
--     setBossFightProtections, since it is an immediate environmental
--     fact, not something contingent on the move being cast) AND bans
--     ONLY that room's own move (so it cannot be toggled back off).
-- All four compose freely (checked together in the single Battle:useMove
-- wrap below): trickRoom alone leaves Magic/Wonder Room castable by either
-- side; trickRoom + dimensionLock together removes room-move access
-- entirely for the rest of the fight.
