-- Real ownership of the paralysis/sleep/freeze turn-loss DECISION,
-- replacing native cartridge-accurate logic with real, current Showdown
-- mechanics -- verified directly against Pokemon Showdown's own real
-- source (data/conditions.ts) before writing any of this, not from
-- memory. Standing project principle (turn_order.lua's own header: "we
-- are the bible and process of combat" -- extended here to status-based
-- turn loss, not just move ordering): the native engine only executes a
-- decision this mod hands it, it never independently decides an outcome
-- via its own RNG. Confirmed BEFORE this file existed that the ported
-- native logic violated this twice over -- not just in ownership, but in
-- accuracy:
--   PARALYSIS: native rolls 63/256 (~24.6%, Gen 1's own byte-based
--     approximation) -- real current rate is exactly 25% (Showdown's own
--     `this.randomChance(1, 4)`).
--   SLEEP: native duration is `rng(1,7)` (Gen 1's own cartridge range)
--     -- real current duration is 1-3 turns lost, uniform (Showdown's
--     own `this.random(2, 5)`, pre-decremented before the first check).
--     Native ALSO always returns "lose the turn" even on the exact turn
--     the mon wakes up -- real current rule lets a mon act immediately
--     on the turn it wakes (Showdown's own bare `return;` -- no value --
--     on the woken branch, vs an explicit `return false` for "still
--     asleep"). Because the wake now happens ON the turn the counter
--     reaches zero (and that turn is PLAYED, not lost), the stored roll
--     must be one higher than the number of turns actually lost: the roll
--     is 2-4 (matching Showdown's `random(2, 5)`, which is 2/3/4), giving
--     1/2/3 lost turns. ROUND 33 FIX: the roll was 1-3, so a freshly
--     inflicted sleep could wake with ZERO lost turns -- impossible in the
--     real games. Applies to both the Gen 1 record and the Gen 2 one.
--     Rest deliberately sets its counter directly (3 -> 2 lost turns,
--     matching Showdown's own `target.statusState.time = 3`), not through
--     `onInflict` -- see THIS file's own Rest note further down.
--   FREEZE: Gen 1's ported native has NO thaw roll AT ALL (`beforeMove`
--     unconditionally returns "still frozen," confirmed by direct read)
--     -- a Gen 1 battle's frozen mon never thaws on its own under the
--     pre-existing code. Gen 2's own native DOES roll (`Battle
--     .THAW_CHANCE`) but at Gen 2's own cartridge rate, not real current
--     Showdown's exactly 20% (`this.randomChance(1, 5)`).
--
-- Monkeypatches each status's own `beforeMove` (and Sleep's own
-- `onInflict`, for the duration roll) directly -- Gen 1's `Status
-- .RECORDS.PAR/SLP/FRZ`, Gen 2's `Battle.STATUSES.paralyze/sleep/
-- freeze` -- the same surgical, per-status-record pattern already
-- proven safe for Poison Heal/Heatproof/Magic Guard's own residual
-- patches. Each replacement keeps the EXACT return contract the engine
-- already consumes (Gen 1: `(canAct, msgs)`; Gen 2: `canAct` plus its
-- own `battle:emit` calls) -- the engine still just executes a decision
-- handed to it, only the decision itself is now ours.
--
-- Early Bird (abilities/data/*.lua's own Phase 8 deferral list named
-- this as unbuilt) is closed here for free, since it's the exact same
-- code path: real rule (Showdown's own `if (pokemon.hasAbility
-- ('earlybird')) { pokemon.statusState.time--; }`) is a SECOND
-- decrement per turn, halving effective sleep duration.
--
-- Sleep Talk/Snore (real moves usable while asleep, Showdown's own
-- `move.sleepUsable` flag) -- national_dex's own moveFlags has no
-- equivalent flag (confirmed, grepped flags.lua directly), so this is a
-- small, real, necessary hardcoded pair -- the same class of thing
-- CRASH_DAMAGE_MOVES/ROOM_MOVE_FLAG already are, not a violation of the
-- "read live, don't hardcode" discipline (there is nothing to read).
