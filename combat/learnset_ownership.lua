-- Learnset ownership: national_dex is the canonical source for WHICH
-- moves a species can learn (its real, unfiltered movepool); GalarGmaxDex
-- decides which of those are actually USABLE right now, gated on its own
-- move-effect completeness. Explicit user decision, this session.
--
-- Why not just ask national_dex "is this modeled": its own gen1Effect/
-- gen2Effect/EffectModeled fields are a static snapshot computed once at
-- national_dex's OWN build time (tools/build_moves.py, not shipped) with
-- zero runtime awareness of any other mod -- confirmed by direct source
-- read, national_dex/src/api.lua:152-159's own comment: "these fields are
-- this mod's own answer". A move GalarGmaxDex fully implements today would
-- still read as unmodeled there. So: national_dex's UNFILTERED extras data
-- (movesFull/movesByMethod, real PokeAPI-derived movepool, not the
-- registered learnset/levelMoves field -- THAT field is filtered by the
-- same stale snapshot) is the canonical "can this species learn this move
-- at all" list; this file's own isUsable() is the "is it actually usable
-- right now" gate, kept as a genuinely separate step on purpose -- explicit
-- user note: national_dex will eventually expose its own generational-
-- ruleset setting, which this mod should consume then. Swapping the
-- canonical-movepool source (or intersecting it with that future setting)
-- should stay a small, local change to canonicalLearnset() below, not a
-- rewrite of the gate or the patching.
--
-- Confirmed empirically (not assumed) before writing this: movesFull/
-- movesByMethod entries' `move` field is USUALLY already the real
-- engine-spelled move id (e.g. "LIGHT_SCREEN", "GIGADRAIN",
-- "DOUBLE_EDGE" -- sampled directly from national_dex's own
-- extras/001.lua). It is NOT always: the Psychic move's extras id is
-- "PSYCHIC", while this engine registers it as PSYCHIC_M so the move
-- cannot collide with the PSYCHIC type (confirmed in the engine's own
-- source: src/battle/gen2/Ai.lua's "PSYCHIC is PSYCHIC_M", and the
-- TM_PSYCHIC_M item id). Writing the raw extras id into a learnset
-- therefore named a record the live `moves` registry does not hold --
-- Schemas.crossValidate turns that into a hard "unresolved reference to
-- moves \"PSYCHIC\"" error, and the battle builder would read the slot as
-- `moveDef and moveDef.pp or 0`, i.e. a 0/0 PP move. So every extras id is
-- reconciled against the live registry through registeredMoveId() below,
-- which is national_dex's own documented use of its replies' `strippedId`
-- field (src/api.lua: "strippedId on the reply is the separator-free
-- spelling the species extras' movesFull and movesByMethod use, for
-- reconciling the two").
--
-- Scope, explicit: level-up learnset (learnset/levelMoves/level1Moves,
-- the only fields this engine's schema actually has per species) plus
-- Gen 2's eggMoves (also a real schema field, src/mods/Schemas.lua:809).
-- TM/tutor legality has no per-species registry field in this schema at
-- all (confirmed: grepped Schemas.lua's whole pokemon field block, only
-- level1Moves/learnset/levelMoves/eggMoves exist) -- whatever gates TM
-- compatibility lives elsewhere in the engine and isn't touched here; a
-- known, stated gap, not silently assumed handled.
