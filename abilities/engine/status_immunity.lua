-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/status_immunity.lua -- Phase 3a of
-- the ability roadmap (PROGRESS.md's own "Phases 2-8" list, status/type
-- immunity next after Phase 2's damage/defense multipliers). That file
-- is only an inclusion list; which status each ability blocks is read
-- LIVE from national_dex's own abilityBehaviorOf here, at check time,
-- every time -- nothing about the effect itself is duplicated into this
-- mod's own data.
--
-- FOUR real infliction sites this engine has, confirmed by direct source
-- read (not assumed) -- every one of them gets its own explicit gate,
-- since none of the three status FAMILIES (hard status, flinch,
-- confusion) shares a primitive with either of the others:
--
-- 1. HARD STATUS (poison/burn/paralyze/sleep/freeze): funnels through
--    exactly one of two shared primitives depending on generation --
--    StatusRegistry.inflict (Gen 1) / Battle:applyStatus (Gen 2) -- the
--    SAME two combat/boss_fight_status.lua's own hardStatus flag already
--    wraps (see that file's own header for the full grounding on why
--    wrapping these two covers every native AND mod-custom hostile
--    status application, and why Rest safely bypasses both). Wrapped
--    again here, independently -- gating by the TARGET's own ability
--    this time, not a battle-wide boss flag, and by the SPECIFIC status
--    the ability blocks, not "every hard status."
--
--    Gen 1 codes (src/battle/Status.lua's own record ids, confirmed:
--    SLP/FRZ/BRN/PAR/PSN) and Gen 2 words (gen2/Battle.lua's own
--    EFFECT_* table, confirmed: sleep/freeze/burn/paralyze/poison) are
--    two genuinely different spellings for the same five statuses --
--    neither matches national_dex's own canonical strings
--    (paralysis/freeze/burn/sleep/poison) exactly, so STATUS_ALIASES
--    below is a real, necessary naming-convention adapter (the same
--    class of thing switchin_stat_change.lua's own STAT_KEY already is),
--    not game data.
--
-- 2. FLINCH: main.lua's installMovepoolEffects sets target.flinched
--    (Gen 1) / battle:volatile(target).flinched (Gen 2) directly, not
--    through any shared primitive -- gated at that call site itself
--    (see the check added there) via hasStatusImmunity below, since
--    there's nothing here to wrap.
--
-- 3+4. CONFUSION: no shared primitive in this mod either (boss_fight_
--    status.lua's own header: "every site writes .confusedTurns/
--    .confuseCount directly"). Three real infliction sites exist, all
--    gated directly at their own call sites the same way: main.lua's
--    secondary-confuse-chance listener, modern_movepool_status.lua's
--    confuseTarget (Flatter/Swagger), and modern_movepool_damage.lua's
--    Outrage/Thrash post-rampage self-confuse -- the third one is
--    self-inflicted, unlike boss-fight softStatus (which deliberately
--    left it untouched, hostile-only in scope), but real Own Tempo does
--    block self-inflicted rampage confusion too, so it's gated here.
--
-- SWEETVEIL is the one ally-scope case (protects allies too, not just
-- self) -- reuses combat/move_targeting.lua's own requestAdjacency, the
-- same primitive switchin_stat_change.lua's Intimidate now uses for the
-- opposite direction (checking foes); here it's the mon's OWN side being
-- checked. See abilities/data/status_immunity.lua's own header for why
-- self is checked unconditionally regardless of the dataset's "allies"
-- scope label.
