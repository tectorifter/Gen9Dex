-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/pressure.lua -- Phase 8 of the
-- ability roadmap.
--
-- Neither engine has PP deduction as its own standalone, named method --
-- it is one inline statement deep inside a much larger function on both
-- sides (`move.pp = (move.pp or 1) - 1` inside Gen 2's own
-- Battle:useMove; `moveInst.pp = math.max(0, moveInst.pp - 1)` inside Gen
-- 1's own BattleState:performMove), each already guarded by real
-- exclusion conditions (charging/rampaging/rolling/biding/called on Gen
-- 2; continuation/struggle/called/enemyUnlimitedPP on Gen 1) this file
-- has no reason to duplicate. Both are wrapped at their real, whole-
-- function level (the same real choke points this mod's own Electro
-- Shot Gen 1 charge fix and Prankster/Embargo/rampage-lock Gen 2 fixes
-- already prove safe) with a plain BEFORE/AFTER read of the move's own
-- `.pp` field -- if it dropped by exactly 1 (meaning the native
-- deduction branch actually ran this attempt, whatever its own reason),
-- Pressure deducts one more per Pressure source. This observes the real
-- outcome rather than re-implementing the native exclusion logic a
-- second time, so it can never drift out of sync with either engine's
-- own real rules for when PP is and isn't spent.
--
-- ROUND 68 (category-3 flag audit): the real `mustpressure` move flag is
-- now read live from national_dex's own moveFlags payload. Showdown marks
-- six moves with it -- Imprison, Snatch, Spikes, Stealth Rock, Tera Blast,
-- Toxic Spikes (confirmed against the generated flags.lua: exactly those
-- six). A normal move only triggers Pressure when it targets the Pressure
-- holder, so the old `defender == the Pressure holder` test silently
-- missed every self/field-targeting move. Showdown's own rule
-- (abilities.ts:3441 `onDeductPP: if (target.isAlly(source)) return;`,
-- fed from `getMoveTargets`' pressureTargets, which `mustpressure` sets to
-- the whole opposing side -- battle-actions.ts:467-484) is: for a
-- mustpressure move, ANY opposing active Pressure holder adds one PP,
-- whatever the move's own target archetype is. That is reproduced here
-- with combat/move_targeting.lua's real roster primitive, so it is
-- N-way-correct in multi-battler battles too.

  -- Real target archetypes a NORMAL move's Pressure extra PP applies to,

  --     if (move.target === 'foeSide') pressureTargets = [];
  --     if (move.flags['mustpressure']) pressureTargets = this.foes();
  -- `targets` is the move's own real, resolved target Pokemon set, so a
  -- move that targets an opposing Pokemon charges Pressure and a move that
  -- targets only itself / its own side / the bare field does not. The one
  -- explicit carve-out is Showdown's `foeSide` ("opponents-field" in
  -- national_dex's own spelling: Spikes / Stealth Rock / Sticky Web / Toxic
  -- Spikes), which is emptied on purpose -- that is exactly the gap the
  -- `mustpressure` flag exists to fill (dex-moves.ts: "Additional PP is
  -- deducted due to Pressure when it ordinarily would not"). So this set is
  -- national_dex's spellings for Showdown's opponent-directed archetypes
  -- (normal/adjacentFoe/any -> selected-pokemon; allAdjacentFoes ->
  -- all-opponents; all/randomNormal -> all-other-pokemon / all-pokemon /
  -- random-opponent), and deliberately omits "opponents-field" plus every
  -- self/own-side/field archetype ("user", "user-or-ally", "user-and-allies",
  -- "all-allies", "ally", "users-field", "entire-field", "specific-move",
  -- "fainting-pokemon"). A `mustpressure` move ignores this set entirely.
