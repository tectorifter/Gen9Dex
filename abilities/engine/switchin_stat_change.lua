-- Dispatch engine for abilities/data/stat_change_switchin.lua -- that file
-- is only an inclusion list; scope/stat/stages are read LIVE from
-- national_dex's own abilityBehaviorOf here, at dispatch time, every time.
-- Nothing about the effect itself is duplicated into this mod's own data -- only
-- two things that genuinely aren't in national_dex's data at all:
--
-- 1. STAT_KEY: PokeAPI's own stat-name spelling (national_dex's behaviour.
--    effects[].stat, e.g. "special-attack") mapped to this engine's own
--    key convention (modern_combat.lua's changeStage store uses "spa",
--    confirmed against every other stat-changing MOVE in combat/
--    modern_movepool_stages.lua) -- a naming-convention adapter, not game
--    data.
-- 2. NATIVE_STATS: which of those keys route through Gen 2's own native
--    stage table (Battle:changeStageAgainstMist) instead of modern_combat
--    .lua's atk/def/spa/spd store -- that file's own header: speed/
--    accuracy/evasion were never held there at all. A pure function of
--    WHICH STAT is involved, so this is derived here rather than stored
--    per-ability anywhere.
--
-- Reuses combat/modern_combat.lua's own changeStage export (the same
-- primitive every stat-changing MOVE already goes through) and Gen 2's own
-- native Battle:changeStageAgainstMist directly for the three
-- native-store stats.
--
-- SUBSTITUTE, confirmed by direct source read after the user pasted
-- Intimidate's own real national_dex record ("This ability has no effect
-- on an opponent that has a Substitute"): modern_combat.lua's changeStage
-- already gates a hostile (fromEnemy) change on the target's Substitute
-- via isProtectedFrom, so INTIMIDATE/INTREPIDSWORD/DAUNTLESSSHIELD (all
-- non-native stats) already respect it correctly for free. Battle:
-- changeStageAgainstMist does NOT -- read directly, gen2/Battle.lua:2071-
-- 2079: it checks ONLY Mist, and the Battle:changeStage it delegates to
-- (gen2/Battle.lua:1299-1313) has no Substitute check anywhere in the
-- chain. Real, confirmed gap for the native-store stats (SUPERSWEETSYRUP's
-- own evasion drop) -- fixed explicitly below (a plain battle:volatile(
-- target).substitute read, the same field isProtectedFrom itself checks)
-- rather than trusted to the native call. A wider pre-existing gap in
-- combat/modern_movepool_stages.lua's own changeNativeStage (any MOVE
-- routing a hostile speed/accuracy/evasion change that way, e.g. Scary
-- Face/Cotton Spore/Sweet Scent) is flagged here but deliberately not
-- touched -- that file is a separate, earlier piece of work outside this
-- task's scope.
--
-- Triggers: battle.started (the very first send-out at battle start --
-- confirmed by direct read, gen2/Battle.lua:340, a SEPARATE event from any
-- switch) and battle.battler_switched (every switch after that). Both are
-- needed -- Intimidate firing only on MID-battle switches and never on the
-- lead Pokemon would be a real, observable bug. Every other switch_in
-- ability engine file in this directory reuses this exact same two-event
-- pattern.
--
-- Third argument (igData, optional): the inclusion table from abilities/data/
-- intimidate_guard.lua, passed through main.lua's boot call. It holds the
-- target-side guard family that exists ONLY in the presence of Intimidate
-- (OBLIVIOUS, GUARDDOG, RATTLED) plus OBLIVIOUS's own entry-cure, none of
-- which belong in this file's stat-change inclusion table. If omitted (an
-- older boot line), every igData check below reads empty and the plain
-- Intimidate path is preserved -- the file degrades safely.
