-- The ability-execution primitive: this mod's first real integration of
-- national_dex's ability DATA (dex.exports.abilityById, 0.30.0+) into
-- actual battle behavior. Nothing before this session executed an ability
-- anywhere in this engine -- confirmed directly (a dedicated research pass
-- grepped the whole base engine and every installed mod): mon.ability
-- exists only as save/display data (stats/engine_modern_stats.lua's own
-- generation/toggle functions, the SummaryMenu page-3 readout), never read
-- by combat logic.
--
-- We do not register abilities -- national_dex already owns the species-
-- ability associations (statsBySpecies(id).abilities) and the ability
-- behavior text (abilityById(id)) -- we only WIRE what's already there
-- into the primitives this mod already has (changeStage, setMonTypes,
-- etc.), the exact same "patch, never register" discipline this mod's own
-- SUBEFFECTS.md already states for moves.
--
-- MODULARITY, explicit user directive: data and engine stay entirely
-- separate for the whole ability system, this file included. abilities/
-- data/*.lua files are pure tables (no logic, no mod.exports -- loaded via
-- loadSibling the same way combat/moves_new.lua's own plain data table
-- already is) keyed by ability id; abilities/engine/*.lua files are pure
-- dispatch logic, each reading exactly one data file and calling exactly
-- one existing primitive. This file is the one exception living outside
-- that split -- it IS the primitive every engine file depends on
-- (abilityIdOf/abilityBehaviorOf), not a per-ability dispatcher itself.
--
-- ROUND 186 -- battle-scoped ability snapshot. Every ability-changing move
-- and ability in this mod writes through setAbility (below), which is
-- combat-only. The pre-round-186 restore captured a mon's own ability
-- lazily the FIRST time that mon was changed and put it back on switch-out
-- and battle end -- but battle end only covered the two ACTIVE battlers, so
-- a benched mon that had been changed and then withdrawn before the fight
-- ended could keep the changed ability into the save. This round gives the
-- ability slot the same explicit battle-scoped lifecycle round 184 gave raw
-- stats: at battle.started (priority 1000 -- ahead of every switch-in
-- ability and ahead of Gen 2's own ability generation at priority 0) EVERY
-- party member with a real ability, on both sides, is snapshotted, and the
-- snapshot is returned on switch-out (the outgoing AND the incoming mon),
-- on faint, and on battle end (the whole roster). Lazy capture inside
-- setAbility still covers a mon whose ability is generated or first changed
-- after the sweep (Gen 2 player abilities in particular, which
-- gen2_modern_stats.lua only generates at battle.started priority 0).
