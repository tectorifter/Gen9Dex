-- Dynamax combat-property processor (round 13).
--
-- Explicit user scope (2026-08-20, restated 2026-09-07): battle_forms owns
-- Dynamax/Gigantamax activation and mechanics end to end -- WHEN a Pokemon
-- Dynamaxes, its 3-turn clock, its Max Move substitution (BATTLE_FORMS_*
-- ids), its damage-volume half (hpscale.lua), its Max Guard, and its sprite
-- sizing on BOTH generations (gen2dynamaxgrow.lua on Gen 2; the Gen 1
-- draw-time seam was this mod's until round 104 removed it -- see below).
-- This mod does NOT decide when a gimmick activates and does NOT provide its
-- own gimmick activation. It READS the activation trigger battle_forms
-- already emits -- mod.battle_forms's own `dynamax_applied` /
-- `dynamax_reverted` events (src/formapi.lua, fired from src/dynamax.lua's
-- own apply/teardown) -- and CONSUMES it to process the Dynamax combat
-- properties battle_forms deliberately leaves open, exactly the same
-- consume-only relationship tera_state.lua already has with `tera_applied`:
--
--   1. Dynamax Level drive. battle_forms' damage-volume half is
--      (30 + L) / 20 -- hpscale.lua reads L from the mon's
--      battleFormsDynamaxLevel stamp, which defaults to 0 (x1.5 HP). The
--      REAL level that should drive that multiplier is the one this mod
--      stores (dynamax_state.lua): per-mon when a trainer set one, else
--      battle_forms' own candy stamp when a Dynamax Candy was used, else
--      the player's per-save progression. On `dynamax_applied` we derive
--      that effective level and mirror it back into the mon's
--      battleFormsDynamaxLevel stamp so battle_forms' own hpscale uses
--      OUR answer (same read-backfill idiom tera_state.lua uses for the
--      tera type). Level 0 (x1.5) stays the default -- an unleveled
--      player who never touched a Candy or a trainer definition behaves
--      exactly as battle_forms ships.
--
--   2. Max Move secondary effects. battle_forms registers every damaging
--      Max Move as NO_ADDITIONAL_EFFECT (its own deliberate scope -- the
--      move data is generic across games and their gmaxmoves.lua has no
--      per-move secondaries). The Showdown-verified secondaries for Max
--      AND G-Max moves are processed in max_move_subeffects.lua, the
--      SAME way this mod processes every other move: a kind="full"
--      move-effects record (invisible to Gen 2's damage-preempting
--      dispatch) plus one shared battle.damage_dealt listener keyed on
--      the move's own effect field. Moves are discovered by battle_forms'
--      own BATTLE_FORMS_<STEM>_<POWER> id convention; the power ladder
--      (90-150 / 70-100 Fighting+Poison / fixed-160 G-Max) stays
--      battle_forms' -- this file never decides base power. maxguard
--      (status) is battle_forms' own -- skipped.
--
-- Round 104 removed the Gen 1 draw-time size-up this file used to carry
-- (the BattleState:drawBattlerPic wrap + its eased grow/shrink tween, plus
-- the gigantamax_size / gigantamax_skip_animation options): battle_forms
-- owns Dynamax sprite sizing on both generations now, so the Gen 1 seam was
-- redundant. The only thing this file still stamps is the __g9Dynamaxed
-- marker that combat/type_override_primitives.lua reads for its Dynamax
-- type-change immunity.
--
-- Why gimmick_dynamax.lua stays DISABLED (canonical-disabled, not
-- deleted): it is a full parallel Dynamax engine -- its own activation
-- ring, its own Max Move resolution, its OWN doubled-HP write and
-- per-battle 3-turn clock. battle_forms already owns all of that (the
-- 2026-08-20 scope note's whole point: a doubled-HP write from this mod
-- on top of battle_forms' would double-count), so booting both would
-- double HP, double substitutes, and race two 3-turn clocks. This file
-- is the consume-only replacement for that parallel engine.
